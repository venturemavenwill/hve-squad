# Squad Behavior Contract and Regression Test Plan

Defines the end result a squad run must produce, so a release can be blocked when it stops producing it.

Every assertion below is derived from the squad source itself — the coordinators, the Scribe, the `squad-*` instruction files, and the `squad` skill references. Nothing here is invented: each case cites the file that states the rule.

## How this plan is used

The suite runs twice against two different refs and the two results are compared.

1. **Baseline run — against `main`.** Establishes that the suite itself is correct. Every case must pass. A case that fails on `main` is a defect in the case, not in the product, and is fixed before proceeding.
2. **Candidate run — against `v0.16.0-pre`.** Any case that passed on `main` and fails here is a regression introduced by the refactor. Any case that fails on both is a pre-existing gap. Any case that only exists for `0.16.0` is a new-feature check.
3. **Pre-release check.** The candidate run is expected green before a release is cut. It is run by hand, not by the release workflow — see *Why the release gate is Tier 0 only* below.

Both runs install the package from a published ref into a scratch directory and exercise it there. They never test the working tree — testing the installed artifact is what catches packaging and reference-resolution defects.

## Tiers

| Tier | What it is | LLM calls | Runs on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Static conformance of the installed package | none | every PR, and the release gate |
| 1 | Live behavioral runs against fixture repos | yes | on demand, by an operator |
| 2 | Semantic comparison against a golden baseline | yes | inside every Tier 1 run, advisory |

Tier 0 is deterministic and free. Tier 1 asserts on **state artifacts on disk**, never on prose, which is what makes it stable despite model nondeterminism. Tier 2 is the only tier that judges wording, and it starts advisory until the noise floor is known.

### Why the release gate is Tier 0 only

A release blocks on Tier 0 and on nothing else. Tier 1 and Tier 2 are dispatched by hand, before or after a cut, and their result is read rather than enforced. Three reasons, and each one is a fact about the suite rather than a preference:

* **It costs Copilot requests and about an hour.** A release triggered by a push to `main` would spend both every time `apm.yml` or the CHANGELOG moves, including on a re-cut of a ref already exercised.
* **It is nondeterministic, and its recent failures were its own.** Of the three dispatched runs before `0.16.0`, two failed — both because the contract asserted something the source did not say, not because the squad regressed. A gate standing on that record blocks releases for test defects.
* **It would not have caught what `0.16.0` shipped.** The defect that reached a live `azure` run — ten claimed stages, no dispatch records — sits behind `mode=autopilot`, and no Tier 1 scenario runs autopilot. Gating on a suite that cannot see the failure class buys confidence it has not earned.

What would change the decision: an autopilot scenario, a measured noise floor across repeat runs on one ref, and a stretch of dispatched runs whose failures are the product's rather than the harness's. Until then the suite's job is to find defects, which it does, and not to hold the tag.

Scribe hand-off pipelining (GATE-22 through GATE-28 below) is one more case this applies to: Tier 0 pins that the contract text reads the way it must, but whether a host actually dispatches Role(N+1) alongside Scribe(N) — and every barrier still holds when it does — is an autopilot behavior, so it stays untested until the autopilot scenario above exists.

## Running the suites

| Command | Spends requests | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `./tests/tier0/Invoke-Tier0Tests.ps1 -SourceRoot .` | no | Static conformance of the tree this branch would deliver |
| `./tests/tier0/Invoke-Tier0Tests.ps1 -Ref v0.16.0` | no | Static conformance of a published ref, as a consumer receives it |
| `./tests/tier1/Invoke-Tier1Tests.ps1 -SelfCheck` | no | Mutation controls proving the state contract can fail |
| `./tests/tier1/Invoke-Tier1Tests.ps1 -SquadRoot <path>` | no | State contract against an existing squad tree |
| `./tests/tier1/Invoke-Tier1LiveRun.ps1 -SourceRoot . -ProvisionOnly` | no | Builds every scenario workspace and stops before the first turn |
| `./tests/tier1/Invoke-Tier1LiveRun.ps1 -Ref v0.16.0` | **yes** | Provisions fixtures, drives real turns, then applies the state contract |
| `./tests/tier2/Invoke-Tier2Tests.ps1` | no | Drift controls proving the comparator can fail |
| `./tests/tier2/Compare-SquadRun.ps1 -ObservationRoot ./tests/tier1/results` | no | Scores a completed Tier 1 run against the golden baselines |

The live harness needs `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, the `apm` CLI, and a pinned `@github/copilot`. Everything else needs only Pester 5.7.1.

## Verified parity evidence

Checked directly while writing this plan, comparing `origin/main` (`de7feef`, 0.15.3) against the branch:

* On `main` the `/squad-document`, `/squad-governance-report`, and `/squad-learn` prompts carry **no `agent:` binding** — the whole procedure is inline and runs on whatever agent the user is in. On the branch each binds to a dedicated agent. This is the single largest behavioral change in the three entrypoints and is why they need output-level cases, not structural ones.
* The moved text is otherwise verbatim. The `docx` conversion command, the `Open Questions` section, the seven governance section titles, the `SL-`/`TL-` id conventions, and both learnings target paths are byte-identical between main's prompts and the branch's agents.

That parity is evidence, not proof. The cases below are what turn it into proof.

## Tier 0 — Static conformance

No Copilot invocation. Install the ref into a scratch directory, then inspect the delivered tree.

| ID | Assertion | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| PKG-01 | `apm install` completes and emits **zero** unpinned-reference warnings | The defect class that made tags non-reproducible |
| PKG-02 | Every agent named in a coordinator `agents:` roster resolves to a delivered `*.agent.md` whose `name:` matches exactly | A roster naming an undelivered agent makes the coordinator stop and escalate at runtime |
| PKG-03 | Every reference file named in an agent's Skill Reference Contract exists at the stated path | A missing reference silently strips the agent's procedure |
| PKG-04 | Every `*.agent.md` prompt body is at most 30,000 characters | Host cap; exceeding it truncates the contract |
| PKG-05 | Every `*.prompt.md` `agent:` value resolves to a delivered agent `name:` | New binding introduced by the refactor |
| PKG-06 | Every agent and prompt frontmatter parses, and agents carry `name`, `description`, `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation` | |
| PKG-07 | `squad-floor.instructions.md` is delivered and declares `applyTo: '**'` | It is the always-on floor; if it is not delivered the floor is silently absent |
| PKG-08 | No relative link inside a delivered skill reference points at a missing file | |
| PKG-09 | All five entrypoint prompts are delivered: `squad`, `squad-federation`, `squad-document`, `squad-governance-report`, `squad-learn` | |
| PKG-10 | Worker agents declare `user-invocable: false`; the three user-facing agents declare `user-invocable: true` | Wrong flag either hides an entrypoint or exposes a worker |
| PKG-12 | Both squad entry points expose and forward `cost-ceiling=<positive USD\|unset>` with same-run inheritance | The lifecycle must be invocable from the delivered prompts |
| PKG-13 | Initialization is outside Cost Preflight; ordinary federation routing forwards one independent ceiling to every selected sub-squad and resets root admission to `not-requested`; only untargeted federation autopilot owns aggregate admission and its federation-root rate table | Prevents bootstrap deadlock, stale aggregate gates, silent ungated sub-squads, and accidental double admission |
| PKG-14 | The plugin build emits byte-identical `plugin.json` files at the distribution root and under `.github/plugin/`, and every generated hook command resolves its script through the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable | VS Code discovers agents through the root manifest, while CLI hooks execute from the consumer repository rather than the installed plugin directory |
| PKG-15 | Every role named in a Squad Profiles or Squad Packs row (`squad-roster.instructions.md`, `references/profiles-and-packs.md`) resolves to a Cast Catalog row in `references/roster-catalog.md` | A profile or pack naming a role the catalog does not carry leaves the coordinator unable to cast it at runtime (Council condition C4) |

## Tier 1 — Single squad

Fixture: a small repository with no `.copilot-tracking/squad/` directory.

### Init

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SQ-01 | After Init, these exist under `.copilot-tracking/squad/`: `team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `state.json`, `notifications.md`, `consumption.md`, `consumption-rates.md`, and a `history/` directory | `squad-state.instructions.md`, State Layout |
| SQ-02 | `history/` contains **no** `<agent>.md` files yet | History is created lazily on first dispatch, never seeded empty |
| SQ-03 | `state.json` parses and carries `schemaVersion`, `updated`, `turn`, `mode`, `activeRoles`, `openEscalations`, `currentRun.{sessionModel,modelOverrides,estCostUsd,estCreditsTotal,costPreflight}`, `notify.{approvalChannel,enabled,email,github.{handle,repo}}` | `entry-schemas.md` |
| SQ-03a | Schema 1.4 `costPreflight` carries exactly `runId`, `roundId`, `ceilingUsd`, `evaluatedSpendUsd`, `remainingUsd`, `plannedDispatches`, `projectedCostUsd`, `reserveMultiplier`, `admissionCostUsd`, `confidence`, `basis`, `decision`, `reason` | `entry-schemas.md` |
| SQ-03b | `remainingUsd = max(0, ceilingUsd - evaluatedSpendUsd)` and `admissionCostUsd = projectedCostUsd x 3.0`; the planned-demand table's unrounded row sum reproduces `projectedCostUsd` | `consumption.md`, Cost Preflight |
| SQ-03c | Medium-confidence `within-ceiling` and valid `approved-over-ceiling` may admit exact named slots; the original `over-ceiling` and every `cannot-confirm` round have no child entry | `gates-and-modes.md`, Cost Preflight Procedure |
| SQ-03d | Every admitted history entry names the matching Cost Preflight Decision Ref and one slot in that round's permitted set | `entry-schemas.md` |
| SQ-03e | Legacy single-squad 1.3 and federation 1.2 state without `costPreflight` is read as no-ceiling `not-requested` state and upgraded on the next write without resetting existing fields | State migration rule |
| SQ-03f | The coordinator's legacy transaction may change only `costPreflight` and the exact schema version; single-squad and federation migrations preserve `notify`, `trigger`, models, totals, and federation fields | `squad-floor.instructions.md` |
| SQ-04 | `state.json` `mode` is one of `interactive`, `autonomous`, `autopilot`; `notify.approvalChannel` is one of `in-chat`, `github-issue`, `webhook` | `squad-state.instructions.md` |
| SQ-05 | `team.md` contains a `## Members` table with columns `Role`, `Member Name`, `Agent Name (Primary)`, `Alternate Agents`, `Selection Cue`, `Invocation`, `Model Tier`, `Deliverable Root` | `squad-roster.instructions.md`, Members Schema |
| SQ-05a | Every row carries a `Selection Cue` value — the condition that picks an Alternate, or `—` when the role has none. The cast catalog is `applyTo`-scoped and does not load on every host, so a roster listing alternates without their cue leaves resolution to a guess | `squad-roster.instructions.md`, Members Schema |
| SQ-06 | Every `Agent Name (Primary)` value in `team.md` matches a delivered agent `name:` | Ties runtime roster to PKG-02 |
| SQ-07 | `routing.md` contains columns `Pattern / Keyword`, `Role(s)`, `Autonomy Tier`, `Parallel-Eligible`; every `Autonomy Tier` is `auto`, `confirm`, or `escalate` | `squad-routing.instructions.md` |
| SQ-08 | Every `Role(s)` value in `routing.md` resolves to a `Role` in `team.md` | Unroutable role means a dead branch |

### Ordinary routing turn

Precondition: an initialized squad. Action: one request that routes to at least one role.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SQ-10 | A `history/<agent>.md` file exists for each dispatched agent | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 2 |
| SQ-10a | **Completeness, both directions.** The set of agents with a new history entry equals the set of roles the run reports as dispatched — no dispatched role without an entry, and no entry for a role the run never claimed | Proof of Dispatch |
| SQ-10b | **No orphan history.** Every `history/<agent>.md` corresponds to an `Agent Name (Primary)` or `Alternate Agents` value in `team.md` | Roster is the source of truth |
| SQ-10c | Each dispatch entry records the request the agent received, the findings or outcome it returned, and the turn it was dispatched on | `entry-schemas.md`, history schema |
| SQ-10d | The history file carries its `# History: <agent>` heading and description frontmatter when created | `entry-schemas.md` |
| SQ-11 | Each dispatch entry is followed by a `#### Consumption` heading (or `#### Consumption — Orchestration`) and a fenced `json` block | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 6 |
| SQ-11a | Those two headings take **no** suffix. `### Consumption`, `#### Consumption Block`, `#### Consumption — Research`, and `#### Consumption — Orchestration (Turn 1)` are all unreadable to the ledger rewrite | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 6 |
| SQ-12 | That JSON block carries exactly these keys in this order: `model`, `model_source`, `priced_as`, `model_tier`, `internal_turns`, `input_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `basis` — ten fields, no rate or cost keys | `entry-schemas.md`, history schema; `scribe-procedure.md` Step 5 |
| SQ-13 | Every numeric field in that block is a bare number — no thousands separators, no `~`, no units, no parenthetical qualifiers | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 6; the ledger rewrite reparses these |
| SQ-14 | **No history entry exists without its consumption block** | `squad-state.instructions.md`, Proof of Dispatch |
| SQ-15 | `decisions.md` grew, and its pre-turn content is byte-identical as a prefix of its post-turn content | Append-only; catches silent rewrites |
| SQ-16 | `consumption.md` contains two separate tables, `## Attribution` and `## Usage & Cost`, never merged into one wide table, each with an `orchestration` row and the latter with a `**Total**` row | `consumption.md` reference |
| SQ-17 | Roles appear in `consumption.md` in roster order, and every dispatched role appears | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 8 |
| SQ-17a | **No idle rows.** A role with no consumption block recorded has no row at all, not a zero row. Seeding the roster as zero rows makes a ledger that never advanced look populated | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 8 |
| SQ-18 | `state.json` `turn` incremented by exactly one, `updated` changed, `activeRoles` equals the set of roles dispatched this turn | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 13 |
| SQ-19 | `state.json` was written **last** — its `updated` is at or after every timestamp written this turn | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 13 |

### Proof of dispatch — the cases that matter most

These are the ones that catch a coordinator quietly doing the work itself, which is the failure mode the whole architecture exists to prevent.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SQ-20 | For every stage the run reports as complete, **both** exist: the domain artifact on disk at that role's `Deliverable Root`, and a `history/<agent>.md` entry carrying its consumption block | `squad-state.instructions.md` and `squad-floor.instructions.md`, Proof of Dispatch |
| SQ-20a | **Exemption.** `cost-manager`, `deployer`, `fact-checker`, `intake-validator`, `asbuilt-author`, `azure-diagnose`, and `aws-diagnose` have no Deliverable Root and write no standalone artifact. For these, the history entry alone is proof; asserting an artifact would be a false failure | `squad-roster.instructions.md`, Deliverable Roots |
| SQ-21 | The deliverable is located at the `Deliverable Root` the roster names for that role — not at a path the coordinator chose | Makes the Artifact Gate a lookup |
| SQ-22 | No stage is reported complete while its history entry is absent | "No history entry means the stage did not happen" |
| SQ-23 | **Negative case.** Point one roster row at an agent that is not installed, then send a request that routes to it. The run must **stop and escalate**. Assert: no deliverable produced for that role, no history entry, an escalation recorded, and no substitute agent dispatched | `squad-coordinator.agent.md`, Dispatch Discipline |
| SQ-24 | **Negative case.** Send a request whose domain matches a bundled specialist skill. Assert the coordinator activated only the `squad` skill and produced no specialist artifact before dispatching; the specialist artifact appears only after the resolved role ran | `squad-coordinator.agent.md`, Dispatch Discipline — the rule added by PR #74 |

### Model routing

Precondition: an initialized squad. These cases check the opt-in `routing=` layer defined in `model-routing.md` — the `off`, `ranked`, and `manual` modes persisted in `team.md`; none of them apply while the mode is `off`.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SQ-25 | **No-policy default.** When `team.md` records no `Model routing:` line and the turn passes no `routing=`, every dispatch omits the `model` parameter entirely, `team.md` carries no `Model` column, and the history entry carries no identity bullets beneath its `#### Consumption` block | `model-routing.md`, Worked Examples: No policy |
| SQ-26 | **Below-floor cell refused.** A `manual` `Model` cell naming an id whose capability class the role's floor (its `team.md` Model Tier) does not admit is refused and logged — a history bullet plus a decision note — and never applied, never silently downgraded; *Manual Model Selection* never offers such an id | `model-routing.md`, Consequence Floors |
| SQ-27 | **Unevaluated ids only by explicit pick.** An id `model-catalog.md` marks `Advertised but Unevaluated` is never auto-ranked or suggested; it dispatches only as an explicit `manual` pick, and that dispatch's identity bullets mark it `unevaluated` | `model-routing.md`, Advertised-but-Uncatalogued IDs |
| SQ-28 | **Watch ignores untrusted routing inputs.** A Watch Mode trigger's issue, PR, or comment text carrying `routing=`, `models=`, `tier=`, `mode=`, or `cost-ceiling=` is recorded as seen-and-ignored, never applied as a control input, and an unattended run never prompts for a model | `model-routing.md`, Watch and Unattended Runs |
| SQ-29 | **Stale catalog falls back.** When `model-catalog.md`'s `Retrieved:` date is more than 90 days old, or the file fails to parse, ranking falls back to `consumption.md`'s static `fast`/`default`/`extended` tiers for every class, and one warning line is logged; the run is never blocked | `model-routing.md`, Stale-Catalog Fallback |
| SQ-30 | **Unknown price never `0`.** An unpriced routed id is priced at the maximum rate of its eligible set within the floor, or returns `cannot-confirm` — never `0` and never a blended rate | `model-routing.md`, Cost Preflight Pricing |
| SQ-31 | **Mode persists.** A turn passing `routing=ranked` or `routing=manual` leaves `team.md` with the matching `Model routing:` line and a `Model` column of Model IDs; the next turn, passing no `routing=`, dispatches under the same mode. `routing=off` removes both and the decision entry lists the removed picks | `model-routing.md`, Routing Modes |
| SQ-32 | **Manual selection asks before dispatch.** Switching to `manual` opens with one question offering to accept every role's suggestion, customize by class, or customize per role, before any role dispatches; every offered id is in the host's available set and admitted by the role's floor | `model-routing.md`, Manual Model Selection |
| SQ-33 | **Ranked picks follow fit, not spelling.** Under `routing=ranked`, each role's `Model` cell equals the top row of *Ranking Algorithm* (fit, then Blended, then generation within a family); for the seeded roster on the Copilot CLI the picks match the ranked worked example | `model-routing.md`, Ranking Algorithm |
| SQ-34 | **Legacy `models=` is not applied.** A turn passing `models=` applies none of its pairs and tells the user once that per-role models now live in the `Model` column under `routing=manual` | `model-routing.md`, Routing Modes |

## Tier 1 — Consumption integrity

Presence of a consumption block is not the same as a correct ledger. These cases check the numbers, and they are almost all pure arithmetic over files on disk — deterministic despite the run that produced them being nondeterministic.

### Per-dispatch block correctness

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CON-01 | `est_cost_usd` equals `((input_tokens × input_rate) + (cached_tokens × cached_rate) + (cache_write_tokens × cache_write_rate) + (output_tokens × output_rate)) / 1e6 × calibration_factor`, within a rounding tolerance | `consumption-rates.md` cost derivation |
| CON-02 | `est_credits` equals `est_cost_usd / 0.01` | Same |
| CON-03 | Each of `input_rate`, `cached_rate`, `cache_write_rate`, `output_rate` matches the row for that `model` in `consumption-rates.md` — no hand-typed rate that drifts from the table | Only that file holds token rates |
| CON-04 | `basis` is exactly one of `estimated` or `tier-default`, never a combined value | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 5 |
| CON-05 | When `basis` is `tier-default`, the rates used are the **tier fallback** rates, priced at the tier's most expensive member — deliberately conservative-high | `consumption-rates.md`, Tier fallback |
| CON-06 | `model_source` is one of `dispatch-reported`, `agent-pinned`, `operator-declared`, `session-inherited`, `cli-pinned`, or the unresolved value — never a free-text string | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 5 |
| CON-07 | `model` is either a model present in `consumption-rates.md` or the literal `unknown` — **never an invented model name** | `squad-scribe.agent.md`: "never carries an invented model name" |
| CON-08 | `priced_as` is populated only when it differs from `model` | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 8 |
| CON-09 | A block is produced for **every** dispatch, including ones where no consumption payload was supplied | `squad-scribe.agent.md`: Step 7 runs for every dispatch recorded in Step 2 |
| CON-10 | Anthropic-family models carry a non-zero `cache_write_rate`; models without one leave it at `0` | `consumption-rates.md` |

### Orchestration overhead

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CON-20 | An `#### Consumption — Orchestration` block exists for the turn — the coordinator's own turns and the Scribe's writes are never uncounted | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 7 |
| CON-21 | The orchestration block covers one coordinator turn **per dispatch round** plus one `Scribe state write` per hand-off; a turn with three dispatch rounds does not record one coordinator turn | Same |
| CON-22 | `consumption.md` carries an `orchestration` row in **both** the Attribution and the Usage & Cost tables | `consumption.md` template |
| CON-23 | The `orchestration` row `Tier` is `mixed` | `consumption.md` template |

### Ledger accumulation — the highest-value group

The ledger has replace semantics but the rows accumulate. The documented failure mode is a Scribe that rewrites from the turn's payload alone, silently deleting every earlier role from the ledger while leaving its history intact. That is invisible unless tested across multiple turns.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CON-30 | **Multi-turn.** Run at least three turns dispatching different roles. After the last turn, `consumption.md` still holds a row for the role dispatched on turn 1 | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 8: "a role dispatched on turn 2 still holds a row on turn 9" |
| CON-31 | **Repeat dispatch.** A role dispatched three times holds **one** row whose token counts and cost are the sum of its three blocks — not three rows and not the latest block only | Same |
| CON-32 | Every row in `consumption.md` is re-derivable from the blocks in `history/*.md`: for each role, the row equals the sum of that agent's blocks | Same: "Derive the rows from every consumption block recorded in `history/*.md`" |
| CON-33 | The `orchestration` row equals the sum of every recorded orchestration block across the run | Same |
| CON-34 | The `**Total**` row equals the sum of all role rows plus the orchestration row, for every numeric column | `squad_cost = sum over dispatched roles of est_cost_usd` |
| CON-35 | **Round-trip.** Delete `consumption.md`, trigger a Scribe write, and assert the regenerated file is equivalent to the deleted one. This proves the blocks are actually parseable, which is the entire reason the format is strict | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 6 |
| CON-36 | **Negative case.** Inject a malformed block (`~8,400 (estimated)` instead of a bare number) and assert it is detected rather than silently dropped from the aggregate | Same: an unparseable block "drops that dispatch out of every later aggregate" |
| CON-37 | `consumption.md` is never left at its seed values while `history/*.md` shows dispatches occurred | `squad-state.instructions.md`, Proof of Dispatch |
| CON-38 | Roles appear in `consumption.md` in the same order as `team.md` | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 8: "mirroring roster order" |

### Rates file and calibration

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CON-40 | `consumption-rates.md` passes the shape check: a per-model rate table with `Input`, `Cached`, `Cache write`, and `Output` columns, plus the tier fallback table, the estimator, and the calibration block | `scribe-procedure.md` Step 4 |
| CON-41 | **Negative case.** Corrupt or truncate `consumption-rates.md`, then run a turn. The Scribe must reseed it from the template rather than silently degrading every estimate | Same: seeds "when the file is missing **or** when the existing file fails the shape check" |
| CON-42 | `calibration_factor` is within `0.25`–`10.0` | `consumption-rates.md` |
| CON-43 | While `observations` is `0`, `calibration_factor` is exactly `1.00` and the ledger carries an **uncalibrated** note | Same |
| CON-44 | Every model named in any consumption block has a rate row in `consumption-rates.md`, or its block is flagged `basis: tier-default` | Cross-check binding CON-03 and CON-05 |
| CON-45 | A calibrated preflight has positive observations, a non-`never` reconciliation date, and `calibration_basis` equal to the current `Observed-on|estimator_revision`; a mismatch is low confidence | `consumption.md`, Calibration |
| CON-46 | Every planned-demand row is rederived from count, the canonical dispatch-class inputs, candidate model rates, and eligible calibration; `auto`, unresolved, unrated, invalid, or incomplete rows cannot admit | `consumption.md`, Cost Preflight |
| CON-47 | `projectedCostUsd` and `admissionCostUsd` are independently rounded to four decimals from the same unrounded row sum; admission is never derived by multiplying an already rounded point estimate | Same |
| CON-48 | Each permitted run/round/slot tuple appears in history at most once | `scribe-procedure.md`, admitted slot consumption |

## Tier 1 — Routing and role selection

Checks that the *right* roles fire, not merely that some role fired. Each case sends a request and asserts on which `history/<agent>.md` files appeared.

### Positive selection

| ID | Request pattern | Must dispatch | Tier | Parallel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTE-01 | `research, investigate, explore, find out` | `researcher` | `auto` | yes |
| RTE-02 | `plan, break down, sequence, design plan` | `lead` | `confirm` | no |
| RTE-03 | `implement, build, code, fix` | `developer` | `confirm` | no |
| RTE-04 | `review, validate, check quality` | `tester` | `auto` | yes |
| RTE-05 | `write tests, add test coverage, regression test` | `qa-engineer` — **not** `tester` | `confirm` | no |
| RTE-06 | `validate, council, design review, go/no-go` | `architect`, `security`, `cost-manager`, `product-owner` together | `confirm` | yes |

`tester` versus `qa-engineer` (RTE-04 against RTE-05) is worth its own pair because the split is read-versus-write and easy to regress: "review this change" is `tester`; "write tests for this" is `qa-engineer`.

### Negative selection and escalation

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RTE-10 | A request matching a pattern whose role is **absent from the active roster** escalates and offers to add the role or switch profiles. It never dispatches, and never substitutes a different role | `squad-routing.instructions.md`, Roster Coverage |
| RTE-11 | A role that maps to `thin charter needed` escalates rather than a substitute being guessed | Dispatch Rules |
| RTE-12 | A GitLab merge-request or pipeline request escalates — the `escalate` tier — and states no dispatchable agent exists, rather than dispatching `product-owner` to do it | Routing notes |
| RTE-13 | A Power Platform request in a squad without the `power-platform` pack escalates **with the install command**, rather than dispatching | Routing notes |
| RTE-14 | When the roster lacks `intake-validator`, the intake gate **escalates** rather than skipping the check | Routing, Intake Gate |
| RTE-15 | An `escalate`-tier match never produces a dispatch — assert no new `history/<agent>.md` for that role | Escalation |

### Sequencing and concurrency

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RTE-20 | All parallel-eligible roles for a turn are dispatched concurrently; non-parallel roles run sequentially | Dispatch Rules |
| RTE-21 | Two `Parallel-Eligible: no` roles matched in one turn produce history entries in a strict sequence, not interleaved — except in interactive mode when the Lead plan's `deliverable-fan-out` shape (or a bounded request's independent items) proves their write sets disjoint (RTE-23, RTE-24) | Same; `gates-and-modes.md`, Plan-Driven Parallelism |
| RTE-22 | **Cost-first model selection.** Read-heavy `auto` roles resolve to the `fast` tier; reasoning-heavy `confirm` roles resolve to `default`. Assert against `model_tier` in each consumption block | Dispatch Rules |
| RTE-23 | **Plan-driven parallelism.** In interactive mode (no `mode=`), owners named by a `deliverable-fan-out` plan whose write sets are disjoint are dispatched concurrently under one confirmation that lists every owner, its tier, and its write set; an `escalate`-tier owner is never batched. Per-stage history and the single Scribe writer are unchanged | `gates-and-modes.md`, Plan-Driven Parallelism |
| RTE-24 | **Parallel dispatch requires disjoint write sets.** When disjointness is not shown by the plan or request (shared file, or one deliverable consuming another's output), or the only reason offered is budget, owners dispatch sequentially in dependency order. Plan-driven parallelism is interactive-only: under `mode=autonomous` it never applies, and `mode=autopilot` uses its own Implement fan-out | Same |

### Methodology enforcement — Research to Plan to Implement to Review

This is the group that proves the squad is a methodology rather than an agent that happens to write code.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RTE-30 | **Cold implementation is refused.** Send an implement request with no research artifact under `.copilot-tracking/research/` that does not meet every bounded-lane criterion (RTE-38). The coordinator must dispatch `researcher` first, not implement | Routing, methodology preconditions |
| RTE-31 | With research present but no plan under `.copilot-tracking/plans/`, and the request outside the bounded lane, the coordinator dispatches `lead` first | Same |
| RTE-32 | The coordinator **never produces** the missing research, plan, or verdict itself — assert no such artifact appears without a corresponding history entry for `researcher` or `lead` | "It never produces the missing research, plan, or verdict itself" |
| RTE-33 | **Closing review is mandatory.** After any implementation-tier role lands a change, `tester` is dispatched as the closing stage — in **every** mode, interactive, autonomous, and autopilot. Assert a `history/<tester-agent>.md` entry exists after every implementation | Routing, Closing Review |
| RTE-34 | With a `Stop` Council Verdict as the latest entry for the topic, an implementation request escalates instead of dispatching the implementer | Routing, council gate |
| RTE-35 | With `Go-With-Conditions`, the implementer is dispatched **and** the consolidated conditions are passed as inputs | Same |
| RTE-36 | A user override of a `Stop` is recorded through the Scribe **before** any implementer dispatches | Same |
| RTE-37 | `backlog-executor` is never dispatched without a finalized handoff; when none exists, `product-owner` is dispatched first | Routing, backlog notes |
| RTE-38 | **Bounded lane accepted.** In interactive mode (no `mode=`), a request that names the exact files and change, has no open questions, one owning role (or independent items each with one owner and disjoint write sets), crosses no council domain, and trips no Impactful-Action, Risk, intake, or discovery trigger skips Research and Plan only: assert the owning role **and** `tester` are dispatched (history entries exist), the coordinator authored no artifact itself, every dispatch ran on the model the routing mode resolves (the lane picks no model), and the Scribe decision entry records `Route: bounded` with each criterion's evidence | `gates-and-modes.md`, Bounded Lane |
| RTE-39 | **Any doubt means the full pipeline.** An ambiguous request, an open question, a crossed council domain, or an unproven criterion runs Research → Plan → Implement → Review as in RTE-30 and RTE-31; no `Route: bounded` is recorded | Same |
| RTE-40 | **`pipeline=full` forces the full pipeline** even when every bounded-lane criterion holds | Same; coordinator Inputs |
| RTE-41 | **`mode=autonomous` and `mode=autopilot` never use the bounded lane**: a fully specified request still runs every stage | Same |
| RTE-50 | **Ordinary turns read less.** With `pwsh` 7+ the coordinator runs `Get-SquadDispatchBrief.ps1` first and, when its `coverage:` line covers the request, reads no reference, agent file, or rate table; otherwise it reads its references whole with `forceReadLargeFiles`, each once per turn, and `profiles-and-packs.md` only for Init, a roster change, or a pack proposal. A bounded owner brief carries the exact files (the full write set), change, validation command, and change-record path and forbids repository exploration beyond a reference search for symbols the owner changes (a dependent outside the named files returns `blocked: not bounded` for the full pipeline) while the owner still follows coding standards, validates, and writes the change record last | Coordinator Skill Reference Contract; `gates-and-modes.md` Bounded Lane; `GetSquadDispatchBrief.Tests.ps1` |

## Tier 1 — Profile seeding

Init with each profile and assert the seeded roster holds exactly the documented member set. Cheap, fully deterministic once Init has run, and it catches a roster template that drifts from the catalog.

| ID | Profile | Expected members |
|---|---|---|
| PRF-01 | `default` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, scribe |
| PRF-02 | `security` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, security, supply-chain, rai, privacy, fact-checker, scribe |
| PRF-03 | `design` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, designer, accessibility, scribe |
| PRF-04 | `accessibility` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, accessibility, designer, scribe |
| PRF-05 | `architecture` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, architect, azure-architect, cost-manager, scribe |
| PRF-06 | `azure` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, azure-architect, iac-author, deployer, asbuilt-author, azure-diagnose, architect, cost-manager, security, modernizer, scribe |
| PRF-07 | `modernization` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, modernizer, architect, azure-architect, iac-author, cost-manager, asbuilt-author, scribe |
| PRF-08 | `compliance` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, security, supply-chain, vuln-manager, privacy, rai, accessibility, risk-manager, scribe |
| PRF-09 | `operations` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, azure-diagnose, performance, observability, asbuilt-author, iac-author, deployer, scribe |
| PRF-10 | `product` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, analyst, designer, product-owner, presenter, technical-writer, experimenter, data-scientist, intake-validator, scribe |
| PRF-11 | `full` | the full 32-role set, and **only** it — no opt-in pack roles |

| ID | Assertion |
|---|---|
| PRF-20 | Applying `power-platform` adds exactly `pp-architect` and `pp-connector`; `m365-copilot` adds exactly `m365-agent-architect` and `m365-agent-integrator`; `aws` adds exactly `aws-architect` and `aws-diagnose` |
| PRF-21 | `federation.md` records applied packs in `+pack` form, for example `azure +power-platform` |
| PRF-22 | Every seeded role has a non-empty `Deliverable Root`, and no two roles at different tiers share a root in a way that makes the Artifact Gate ambiguous |
| PRF-23 | Every seeded role's `Agent Name (Primary)` resolves to a delivered agent — the runtime counterpart of PKG-02 |

## Tier 1 — Federation

### Federation init

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FD-01 | Federation root holds `federation.md`, `meta-routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `state.json`, and a `history/` directory | `squad-federation.instructions.md`, Federation State Layout |
| FD-02 | Each sub-squad root `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/` holds `team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `notifications.md`, `state.json`, `consumption.md`, `consumption-rates.md`, and `history/` | |
| FD-03 | `history/<sub-squad>.md` exists at the federation root for every registered sub-squad | |
| FD-04 | `federation.md` has columns `Sub-squad`, `Profile`, `Kind`, `Location`, `Owner`, `Description`; every `Kind` is `in-repo`; every `Location` equals `members/<Sub-squad>/` | Registry Schema |
| FD-05 | Every `Sub-squad` name is lower-kebab-case and unique | Sub-Squad Naming and Uniqueness |
| FD-06 | `meta-routing.md` has columns `Pattern / Domain`, `Sub-squad`, `Parallel-Eligible`; every `Sub-squad` value exists as a row in `federation.md` | Meta-Routing Schema |

### Promotion — single squad to federation

This is the highest-risk operation in the system because it moves state. Fixture: a squad with several turns of accumulated history, decisions, and deliverables. Take a full checksum manifest before promoting.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FD-10 | Precondition detection: promotion runs only when a top-level `team.md` exists and no top-level `federation.md` exists | Promotion Mode trigger |
| FD-11 | Nothing is written before the user confirms | "Nothing is moved or written before the user confirms" |
| FD-12 | After promotion the top-level `team.md` is **gone**, and the full tree is present under `members/<name>/` | Step 2 |
| FD-13 | **Every append-only file is byte-identical** to its pre-promotion checksum: `decisions.md`, every `history/<agent>.md`, every per-dispatch consumption block | Step 2, byte-for-byte guarantee |
| FD-14 | `team.md` is the **only** file whose content changed, and within it only the `Deliverable Root` column | Step 5 |
| FD-15 | Every `Deliverable Root` cell that began with `.copilot-tracking/` now reads `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/...` — the `.copilot-tracking/` segment is **replaced**, not prepended to. Cells beginning `docs/` or `outputs/` are unchanged | Step 5, disambiguated by `squad-roster.instructions.md`: a sub-squad roster reads `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/product/plans/` |
| FD-15a | **Strongest form.** Every rebased `Deliverable Root` cell resolves to a directory that actually exists on disk after promotion. This is the assertion that catches a literal prepend producing `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/.copilot-tracking/plans/` | See the source ambiguity noted below |
| FD-16 | Deliverable directories were enumerated **from disk**, not from the roster table: every directory under `.copilot-tracking/` except `squad/` was offered as a candidate | Step 3 |
| FD-17 | No source file was removed before its destination copy existed and verified — assert zero data loss by comparing the full manifest | Copy, Verify, Then Delete |
| FD-18 | Federation `decisions.md` first entry records the promotion and the source-to-destination move | Step 6 |
| FD-19 | `federation.md` has exactly one row, with `Location` = `members/<name>/` and `Profile` inferred from the moved `team.md` | Step 6 |
| FD-20 | `members/<name>/history/scribe.md` carries the promotion's orchestration consumption block, and federation `state.json` `currentRun` totals are seeded from the relocated ledger total row | Step 7 — the ledger must not show a gap across the boundary |
| FD-21 | After promotion, detection flips: `/squad-federation` owns turns and `/squad` detects the federation and defers | Detection precedence |

### Expansion

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FD-30 | New sub-squad tree seeded at `members/<new>/` with the same file set as FD-02 | Expansion Step 2 |
| FD-31 | `federation.md` and `meta-routing.md` are **read-merge-written**: every pre-existing row and route is byte-identical afterward, with the new ones appended | Expansion Step 3, preserve-on-replace |
| FD-32 | Federation `decisions.md` gained an entry recording the addition; `history/<new>.md` created | Expansion Step 3 |
| FD-33 | **Negative case.** Adding a sub-squad whose name collides with an existing `members/<name>/` directory is refused | Naming and Uniqueness |

### Meta-routing turn

| ID | Assertion |
|---|---|
| FD-40 | A request routed to a sub-squad appends to federation `history/<sub-squad>.md` and to that sub-squad's own state under `members/<name>/`, with the full single-squad ordinary-turn contract (SQ-10 to SQ-19) holding at the sub-squad root |
| FD-41 | Federation-level state records the meta-routing decision; sub-squad state records the role dispatches. Neither is written into the other |
| FD-42 | A sub-squad's **inner run** reads and writes only inside its own root. It cannot discover another sub-squad's work on its own, and it does not read federation-level state | `squad-federation.instructions.md`, Cross-Sub-Squad Handoff |
| FD-43 | Federation admission equals selected inner admission costs plus federation coordinator and root-writer admission cost; accumulated federation spend adds realized inner totals and meta-orchestration exactly once | `squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md`, Federation Cost Ceiling |
| FD-44 | Federation current state preserves its closed `notify` object through initialization and 1.2 to 1.3 migration | `federation-templates.md` |
| FD-45 | A federation meta slot enters accumulated spend only after its id appears in completed history, and duplicate transition references count once; future slots remain reserved only | `scribe-procedure.md`, federation state advance |

## Tier 1 — Post-promotion functional continuity

FD-10 to FD-21 prove the *files* moved correctly. These prove the squad still **works** afterwards. Run the full single-squad contract again, rooted at `members/<name>/`, on a squad that was promoted rather than freshly seeded.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FD-60 | The entire single-squad ordinary-turn contract (SQ-10 to SQ-19) holds at `members/<name>/` after promotion, on a turn run post-promotion | Federation reuses every existing mechanism unchanged |
| FD-61 | The entire consumption-integrity contract (CON-01 to CON-44) holds at `members/<name>/` after promotion | Same |
| FD-62 | **The ledger spans the boundary.** `members/<name>/consumption.md` after promotion includes the roles dispatched **before** promotion. The pre-promotion history blocks must still aggregate into the post-promotion ledger | Promotion Step 7: "a recorded turn rather than a gap in the ledger" |
| FD-63 | Federation `state.json` `currentRun` cost totals are non-zero and equal the relocated ledger's total row — the federation must not report a zero-cost first turn | Promotion Step 7 |
| FD-64 | CON-32 still holds across the move: every row in the relocated `consumption.md` is re-derivable from the blocks in the relocated `history/*.md` | Ledger accumulation |
| FD-65 | A post-promotion dispatch writes its deliverable to the **rebased** root, not the old repository-root path | Deliverable Roots rebasing |
| FD-66 | **Escaped-root detection.** Force a role to write to the repository-root tracking path. The coordinator must treat that as a **failed stage** and re-dispatch with the rebased path stated explicitly | `squad-roster.instructions.md`: "has escaped its root" |
| FD-67 | The gates still fire post-promotion: run a council, a discovery, and an intake turn at `members/<name>/` and assert GATE-01 to GATE-08 hold there | Federation reuses mechanisms unchanged |
| FD-68 | `/squad-document` and `/squad-governance-report` scoped to the promoted sub-squad still produce their documented output, reading the relocated state | DOC and GOV contracts |
| FD-69 | Roster resolution still works: every `Agent Name (Primary)` in the relocated `team.md` resolves, and a dispatch succeeds through it | SQ-06 post-promotion |

## Tier 1 — Cross-Sub-Squad Handoff

A sub-squad **can** build on another's data, but only through a defined handoff. Isolation is write-side and discovery-side; reads happen only via paths the Federation Coordinator resolves and hands over. This group is where a silent divergence between two sub-squads would show up.

### The sanctioned path

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FD-50 | A consumer sub-squad cannot discover a producer's artifact on its own — with no handoff, a `product` PRD at `members/product/plans/` is invisible to a run scoped to `members/azure/` | "cannot discover another's work on its own" |
| FD-51 | Federation `decisions.md` is **not** a discovery mechanism — the inner run does not consult it as a path index | Same |
| FD-52 | Only the Federation Coordinator sees both roots; it resolves the producer's artifacts and hands them to the consumer as **explicit read-only input paths** | "A consumer that was handed no paths was handed no dependency" |
| FD-53 | The handoff passes the producer's **artifacts**, not its state — the PRD, research, or plan file, with `decisions.md` and `history/` passed alongside as context only, never as a substitute | "The interface is the producer's artifacts, not its state" |
| FD-54 | Paths are resolved by reading the producer's `team.md` `Deliverable Root` cells, then **verified by listing** before being passed. Assert every handed path was enumerated this turn and exists | "A handoff path that this turn did not enumerate is a guess" |
| FD-55 | **Ordering.** The producer runs to completion — including its artifact gate — before the consumer is dispatched, and the pair is **never parallel-eligible**, even when meta-routing fans out to both | "Producer before consumer" |
| FD-56 | The fan-out proposal states the ordering to the user | Same |
| FD-57 | **Read-only across the boundary.** The consumer never writes into `members/<producer>/`, never edits a producer artifact, and never appends to a producer's logs. Checksum the producer's whole tree before and after the consumer's run | "Read-only across the boundary, always" |
| FD-58 | A consumer change implying an edit to a producer artifact is **routed back to the producer** as a request, not applied across the boundary | Same |
| FD-59 | **The handoff is recorded.** A federation-level `decisions.md` entry names the producer, the consumer, and the artifacts passed | "Record the handoff" |

### Missing-input recovery

The documented worst case is a consumer that re-derives requirements the producer never agreed, producing a plausible deliverable whose divergence is invisible in the output. These cases exist to make sure that cannot happen.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FD-70 | **Never re-derive.** With the producer's deliverable root empty, the consumer is **not** dispatched to work it out | "never falls back to re-derivation" |
| FD-71 | **Case 1 — producer registered but has not run.** The producer runs first, then the consumer resumes **in the same turn** once the artifact verifies on disk. The user does not re-issue the request | Recovery order, case 1 |
| FD-72 | An interactive turn states what will run and waits for a go-ahead; an autopilot or Watch Mode run proceeds without asking | Same |
| FD-73 | **Case 2 — artifact partial or stale.** Only the producing **stage** is re-dispatched inside the producer sub-squad, not the whole sub-squad, and the run says which artifact fell short and how | Recovery order, case 2 |
| FD-74 | **Case 3 — no sub-squad owns the artifact.** Federation Expansion is offered, or a user-supplied path accepted. The work is **not** routed to the consumer merely because it is the sub-squad in front of the coordinator | Recovery order, case 3 |
| FD-75 | **Case 4 — user override.** Proceeding with a gap records it as an explicit assumption in the `Ready-With-Gaps` shape, and the consumer's output carries a visible statement of what it assumed and who chose to proceed | Recovery order, case 4 |
| FD-76 | **Bounded loop.** One producer run per handoff per turn; a second consecutive miss on the same artifact escalates rather than looping | "Bound the loop" |
| FD-77 | Every producer run and re-dispatch during recovery is a normal Scribe-recorded stage with its own history entry **and consumption block** — recovery is never invisible in the ledger | Same; binds recovery to CON-09 |

## Tier 1 — Deliverable Root resolution

The `Deliverable Root` cell is the running value and the Artifact Gate's lookup key, so a wrong cell breaks proof-of-dispatch everywhere. A hand-edited cell is explicitly supported, which makes "does a manual edit actually take effect" a first-class case rather than an edge case.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| DLR-01 | **`team.md` is the authority at dispatch time, not the catalog table.** The agent is handed the root read from the resolved roster row, and the Artifact Gate looks in that same cell | `squad-roster.instructions.md` |
| DLR-02 | **A hand-edited cell takes effect on the very next dispatch**, with no reseed and no other change. Edit a cell to a custom directory, dispatch that role, and assert the artifact lands there | "takes effect on the very next dispatch" |
| DLR-03 | The Artifact Gate looks for the artifact at the **edited** cell, so proof-of-dispatch still passes with a custom root | Same |
| DLR-04 | **Never normalized back.** A subsequent turn does not rewrite the edited cell to the catalog default | "never normalize a user-edited cell back to the default" |
| DLR-05 | **Not treated as drift.** No turn reports the divergence between the edited cell and the catalog table as something to repair | "never treat a divergence between the two as drift to repair" |
| DLR-06 | **Roster refresh preserves edits.** A refresh reseeds a `Deliverable Root` only for a role whose row it is **adding**; every pre-existing edited cell is byte-identical afterward | "A roster refresh preserves edited cells" |
| DLR-07 | A plain squad's roster resolves to `.copilot-tracking/plans/`; a sub-squad's resolves to `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/plans/` | "The table holds `squadRoot`-relative roots; `team.md` holds resolved ones" |
| DLR-08 | **Negative case.** A federation roster carrying a bare repository-root tracking path is a **seeding defect** and must be detected, not accepted | "is a seeding defect, not a variant" |
| DLR-09 | `docs/` and `outputs/` never take a sub-squad prefix, in a plain squad or a federation | "the two absolute exceptions" |
| DLR-10 | `outputs/` resolves relative to the project root regardless of which sub-squad ran | Same |

### Hand-edited roots across promotion

This is the intersection the user asked about, and it is the case most likely to break, because three separate promotion steps have to agree.

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| DLR-20 | Edit a role's `Deliverable Root` to a custom path under `.copilot-tracking/`, produce an artifact there, then promote. The custom directory is enumerated as a promotion candidate **from disk** — it is not in the catalog table, so a table-driven enumeration would miss it entirely | Promotion Step 3: "never from the table" |
| DLR-21 | The candidate list is confirmed with the user before anything moves | Step 3 |
| DLR-22 | The custom directory and its contents are relocated under `members/<name>/`, byte-for-byte | Step 4 |
| DLR-23 | The edited cell is rebased to point at the relocated custom directory — **not** normalized back to the catalog default | Step 5: "including a path the consumer edited by hand, so a customized root survives the promotion pointing at its own relocated directory" |
| DLR-24 | **The decisive assertion.** After promotion, the rebased edited cell resolves to a directory that exists and contains the pre-promotion artifact. Cell and disk must agree | Combines Steps 3, 4, and 5 |
| DLR-25 | A dispatch immediately after promotion writes to that rebased custom root | DLR-02 post-promotion |

### Source ambiguity worth resolving

Promotion Step 5 says to "prefix each `Deliverable Root` cell that begins with `.copilot-tracking/` with `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`". Read literally, prefixing `.copilot-tracking/plans/` yields `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/.copilot-tracking/plans/`.

Step 4 moves that directory to `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/plans/`, and `squad-roster.instructions.md` states the resolved form plainly: "a sub-squad's roster reads `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/product/plans/`". So the intent is unambiguous — **replace** the leading `.copilot-tracking/` segment, do not prepend to it — but Step 5's wording does not say that, and a literal reading produces a path that does not exist.

FD-15a and DLR-24 are written to fail on the literal reading. Tightening Step 5's wording to match the roster instruction would remove the ambiguity at the source.

## Tier 1 — Squad Document

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| DOC-01 | With no `outputPath`, the file lands at `docs/squad-document-<YYYY-MM-DD>.<ext>` and the directory is created if absent | `squad-document.agent.md` |
| DOC-02 | Formats `md`, `html`, `pdf`, `docx` are accepted; an unrecognized value falls back to `md` **and the run says so** | |
| DOC-03 | When the `docx` toolchain is unavailable, the run falls back to `md` and says so rather than failing | |
| DOC-04 | The output carries an **Open Questions** section, valued `none` when there are none | |
| DOC-05 | **Squad state is unmodified.** Checksum every file under `.copilot-tracking/squad/` before and after; all must match | "Squad state is read-only input" |
| DOC-06 | No new dispatch history, decision, or consumption entry was written — this agent does not persist squad state | |
| DOC-07 | With `squad=<name>` in a federation, no file outside that sub-squad's root was read | Federation boundary |
| DOC-08 | The output path resolves to the local filesystem; a remote or URL target is refused | |

## Tier 1 — Governance Report

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| GOV-01 | With no `outputPath`, the file lands at `docs/squad-governance-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.html` | `squad-governance-report.agent.md` |
| GOV-02 | The HTML contains all seven sections, in order, titled exactly: `1. Governance Gates`, `2. Council Verdicts`, `3. Cost Breakdown`, `4. Role Dispatch Activity`, `5. Risk & Compliance`, `6. Activity Timeline`, `7. Key Outcomes This Period` | |
| GOV-03 | The stats grid carries six metrics: Coordination Turns, Role Dispatches, Est. Cost, Total Tokens, Human Gates Fired, Escalations | |
| GOV-04 | **Empty-state, not omission.** Run against a squad with no council verdicts; section 2 must still render, with an empty-state message | |
| GOV-05 | **Self-contained.** No `src` or `href` resolving to an external origin, no CDN reference, no external JavaScript library | |
| GOV-06 | Squad state is unmodified — same checksum assertion as DOC-05 | |
| GOV-07 | Counts are grounded: the reported role-dispatch count equals the number of dispatch entries actually present across `history/*.md` | "Never invent data points, fabricate counts" |
| GOV-08 | When cost data includes uncalibrated turns, the cost figures are annotated with calibration state | |

## Tier 1 — Squad Learn

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| LRN-01 | The drafted entry uses the shipped schema columns: `id`, Scenario / Trigger, Learning / Rule, Scope / Applicability, Source Context, Date Added | `squad-learn.agent.md` |
| LRN-02 | **Sanitization.** Seed local memory with a fake secret, a fake customer name, an absolute path, and an internal URL. None may appear in the draft | Sanitization checklist |
| LRN-03 | `target=upstream` produces an `SL-` id and targets `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/learnings/shared-learnings.md`; `target=tenant` produces a `TL-` id and targets `squad-src/.github/skills/squad-learnings-tenant/tenant-learnings.md` | Target resolution |
| LRN-04 | The chosen id is the next free number, read from the existing rows | |
| LRN-05 | **Impactful-action gate.** With approval withheld, no fork, no push, and no pull request occurs. The run states exactly what it would do and to which repository, then stops | "Nothing is forked, pushed, or opened without explicit user approval" |
| LRN-06 | **Live memory is unmodified.** Checksum memory files before and after | |
| LRN-07 | The deployed `shared-learnings.md` in the consumer is never edited in place | |
| LRN-08 | **Negative case.** When sanitization cannot be confirmed, the run stops rather than proceeding | |

## Tier 1 — Gates

| ID | Assertion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| GATE-01 | A Discovery run appends `## Discovery Verdict <timestamp> <topic-id>` to `decisions.md` with fields `Topic`, `Opt-In`, `Depth`, `Roles Dispatched`, `Brief`, `Handoff`, and sections Framing, Options Considered, Objections, Riskiest Assumption, Open Questions, Discovery Gate | `squad-discovery-gate.instructions.md` |
| GATE-02 | The discovery brief exists at the `analyst` Deliverable Root named `<date>-<topic-id>-brief.md` | |
| GATE-03 | The gate never fires unprompted — a plain request with no opt-in produces no Discovery Verdict | "opt-in and additive" |
| GATE-04 | An Intake run appends `## Intake Readiness Verdict <timestamp> <topic-id>` with `Verdict` in `Ready`, `Ready-With-Gaps`, `Not-Ready`, a five-row Findings table (Completeness, Clarity, Testability, Consistency, Scope Boundaries), and an Intake Gate block | `squad-intake-gate.instructions.md` |
| GATE-05 | On `Not-Ready`, remediation runs and is capped at **two** cycles; a third cycle escalates instead | |
| GATE-06 | A Council run appends `## Council Verdict <timestamp> <topic-id>` with `Verdict` in `Go`, `Go-With-Conditions`, `Stop`, a Findings by Role table, a Synthesis block, and an Implementation Gate block | `squad-council.instructions.md` |
| GATE-07 | **Most-restrictive-wins.** Inject one `Block` from any single role; the Council Verdict must be `Stop` and `Permits Implementation Dispatch` must be `no` | |
| GATE-08 | **Most-restrictive-wins, softer label.** Inject a `Concern` carrying `Risk: High`; the verdict must still be `Stop` | Explicitly called out in the source |
| GATE-09 | Autopilot writes `history/autopilot-run-<id>.md` with `Topic`, `Opt-In`, `Cost Ceiling`, `Outcome`, and a Stages table | `squad-autopilot.instructions.md` |
| GATE-10 | **Impactful-Action Gate never proceeds unattended.** In an autopilot run, no `git push`, no merge, no deploy, no destructive data operation occurs without approval | |
| GATE-11 | Autonomous writes `history/autonomous-loop-<id>.md` with an Iterations table, and escalates on any `Stop`, any `Risk: High` from security, cost-manager, or rai, and on any irreversible write | `squad-autonomous.instructions.md` |
| GATE-12 | Notifications append to `notifications.md` with fields `Mode`, `Channel`, `Approval Ref`, `Topic`, `Awaiting`, `Resolved` | `squad-notifications.instructions.md` |
| GATE-13 | A configured ceiling writes and reads back Cost Preflight before the first child or Scribe dispatch and before every later dispatch round | `gates-and-modes.md`, Cost Preflight Procedure |
| GATE-14 | `over-ceiling` and `cannot-confirm` permit no child dispatch; low confidence never degrades to point-estimate admission | Same |
| GATE-15 | Explicit proceed appends `approved-over-ceiling` linked to an immutable matching denial and human approval; it never admits `cannot-confirm`, changed or expanded demand, or a dispatch at or above the ceiling | Same |
| GATE-16 | Watch Mode records `over-ceiling` as a blocking finding and resumes sequentially only after authorized proceed; `cannot-confirm` remains blocked | `squad-watch-mode.instructions.md` |
| GATE-17 | A targeted federation forwards to one inner preflight; an approved aggregate federation runs one sequential sub-squad unit at a time and starts none at or above the aggregate ceiling | `squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md` |
| GATE-18 | A rolling round removes completed slots, uses current estimated spend as `evaluatedSpendUsd`, and blocks routing expansion outside its evaluated set until recalculation | `consumption.md`, Cost Preflight |
| GATE-19 | Positive fixtures cover denied, cannot-confirm, approval-note-only, approved overage, ceiling reached, Watch denial at schema 1.4, targeted federation forwarding, aggregate federation accounting, rolling rounds, and legacy migration | `Assertions.Tests.ps1` |
| GATE-20 | A completed approved dispatch may cross the estimated ceiling, but no history entry may be timestamped after the terminal ceiling-reached round | `StateContract.Tests.ps1` |
| GATE-21 | A positive input sets the ceiling; omission inherits only inside the same run; `cost-ceiling=unset` and a new run with no value use the exact `not-requested` state without resetting accumulated totals | `consumption.md`, Cost Preflight |
| GATE-22 | The coordinator carries exactly one pointer line (≤200 chars, excluding the retained `state.json` tail) to the pipelining contract, and both named sections it points to — `### Scribe Hand-off Pipelining (Autopilot)` and `### Scribe Hand-off Pipelining: Enablement Predicate and Barriers` — exist in `operating-procedure.md` / `gates-and-modes.md` | `squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `references/operating-procedure.md`, `references/gates-and-modes.md` |
| GATE-23 | The Enablement Predicate `PipeliningEnabled` is required whenever it holds (dispatching stage N's Scribe alone while it holds and no barrier applies is a defect, stated in both coordinators and the autopilot instructions) and its host term turns on only when the coordinator's own subagent-dispatch tool can be called more than once in a single parallel tool-call block (VS Code `runSubagent`, Copilot CLI `task` with or without `mode: background`) — never a hardcoded value; the term governs gain, not safety; the coordinator hands the Scribe a `ledgerCommand` that the Scribe runs instead of hand-writing the ledger | `gates-and-modes.md`, `operating-procedure.md`, `squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`, `scribe-payload-template.md`, `squad-scribe.agent.md` |
| GATE-24 | A configured cost ceiling does not disable pipelining: the round admitting stage N+1 adds stage N's unrecorded spend as a pending reservation (`evaluated_spend_usd = currentRun.estCostUsd + pending_usd`), and only an `approved-over-ceiling` round stays sequential; Watch Mode and the federation root stay sequential regardless of the predicate, while an untargeted federation inner run pipelines at its own root because its aggregate ceiling is read only after that inner run drains; the retired ceiling latch never resurfaces | `gates-and-modes.md`, `consumption.md`, `squad-autopilot.instructions.md`, `squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`, `squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md`, `references/federation.md` |
| GATE-25 | Single-writer invariant: at most one Scribe hand-off is ever in flight per squad root, later stages' hand-offs queue strictly in stage order; depth-1 rule: stage N+2 is never dispatched before stage N's Scribe hand-off has returned and passed verification | `operating-procedure.md`, `squad-floor.instructions.md`, `squad-state.instructions.md` |
| GATE-26 | The barrier list names a documented minimum of 11 items, including a council verdict consumed by Implement, an intake gate verdict, a discovery gate verdict, every Cost Preflight write (which drains the prior block and runs between blocks, never beside a Scribe hand-off), the Risk Gate, the Impactful-Action Gate, and the final-outcome gate | `gates-and-modes.md`, `operating-procedure.md` |
| GATE-27 | Every Scribe write is confirmed with `-Check -ExpectedHistoryCounts` paired with `-BaselinePath`; a bare `-Check` or a count-only `-Check -ExpectedHistoryCounts` is not a write verification by itself; a failed verification is corrected with a new, append-only Scribe correction entry, never a re-run of the originating stage; resume re-sends the hand-off for the affected stage only, never re-runs the stage that produced the artifact | `operating-procedure.md`, `gates-and-modes.md`, `squad-autopilot.instructions.md` |
| GATE-28 | The negative-space sentence "never merge two stages' Scribe payloads into one hand-off" is single-homed in `operating-procedure.md` (not duplicated in `gates-and-modes.md` or `federation.md`); "`state.json` advances per stage" is retained verbatim; a host whose subagent-dispatch tool cannot be called more than once in one parallel tool-call block keeps dispatching one stage's Scribe hand-off, waiting for it, and only then dispatching the next — exactly as before pipelining existed | `operating-procedure.md`, `squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-autopilot.instructions.md`, `gates-and-modes.md` |

Tier 0 pins GATE-22 through GATE-28 in `tests/tier0/ScribeHandoffPipelining.Tests.ps1`. They prove the pipelining **contract text** reads the way it must; they do not exercise a pipelined dispatch, which stays gated on the autopilot Tier 1 scenario called for below (see the L33/L35 and Sequencing-step-7 notes). R-12 (the `byte-budget-baseline.json` vs. `prefill-baseline.json` `scribe-hot-core` file-count discrepancy) is **not triggered** by this delivery: `scribe-procedure.md` did not grow, so `byte-budget-baseline.json`'s existing 5-file, 82,394-byte budget stands unchanged; `prefill-baseline.json` was regenerated per the documented `-UpdateBaseline` procedure and its `scribe` sessionType file count now also reads 5 (an incidental correction from the regen tool's own file-enumeration logic, not a manual R-12 fix).

## Tier 2 — Semantic comparison

Advisory until the noise floor is measured. For the same fixture and the same request, compare the candidate run against a golden baseline captured from the last good release, and score:

* Did it route to the same roles?
* Did it produce the same deliverable types at the same roots?
* Did it fire the same gates with the same verdicts?
* Is the synthesized answer materially equivalent?

Report the score in the job summary. Promote to blocking only after enough runs to distinguish drift from ordinary variance.

### How it is measured

Each Tier 1 scenario emits an `observation.json` reduced from files on disk, never from the run's prose: roles from the per-agent history resolved through `team.md`, deliverables from `git status` against the fixture baseline with the state directory excluded, and gate verdicts from the `## Council Verdict` and `## Intake Readiness Verdict` entries the Scribe stamps into `decisions.md`.

Deliverables compare as `root` plus extension, not as filenames. The topic slug in a filename is the model's to choose, so comparing it would score ordinary wording variance as drift; the root is the roster's promise and must not move.

The answer dimension is the only judged one, and it is off by default. When it is skipped its weight is redistributed rather than counted as zero, so a skipped judge cannot silently fail a candidate. A judge that times out or returns nothing parseable reports "not judged" for the same reason — a broken judge is not evidence of drift.

| ID | Assertion |
|---|---|
| SEM-01 | A scenario with no baseline is reported as unbaselined, never as a failure |
| SEM-02 | Rescoring a freshly captured baseline against its own run yields 1.0 |
| SEM-03 | A dropped or added role moves the routing score and is named in the report |
| SEM-04 | A deliverable that moved root, or stopped being produced, moves the deliverables score |
| SEM-05 | A deliverable renamed at the same root and type does **not** move the score |
| SEM-06 | A flipped or dropped gate verdict moves the gates score |
| SEM-07 | The latest attempt is the one scored, so a scenario that passed on retry is judged on the run that counts |

## Intended deltas from `main` to `0.16.0`

Triage aid: a difference in this list is expected and is **not** a regression.

| Delta | Effect on the suite |
|---|---|
| `/squad-document`, `/squad-governance-report`, `/squad-learn` gain an `agent:` binding | PKG-05 and PKG-10 are new checks. DOC, GOV, and LRN cases must pass identically on both refs |
| Three new agents delivered: Squad Document, Squad Governance Report, Squad Learn | PKG-02 roster counts change |
| `squad-floor.instructions.md` added; root `AGENTS.md` removed | PKG-07 is a new check. The floor rules it carries were previously stated elsewhere, so behavioral cases must not change |
| `squad` SKILL.md split into a router plus reference files | PKG-03 is a new check. No behavioral case may change |
| Coordinators and Scribe converted to thin Skill Reference Contract agents | This is the change with the widest blast radius. Every Tier 1 case exists to prove it preserved behavior |
| PR #74's specialist-skill rule | SQ-24 is new; it must pass on `main` too, since #74 is already merged there |

## Determinism and cost controls

* **Pin the model** on every Tier 1 run. Results across runs are not comparable otherwise.
* **One automatic retry** before declaring a Tier 1 failure, with both attempts logged. Distinguishes flake from regression.
* **Fixtures stay small** — cost and runtime scale with fixture size.
* **Checksum manifests** before and after every read-only entrypoint case. This is the cheapest high-value assertion in the plan and it needs no judgement.
* **Timeouts and a concurrency group**, so a hung run cannot stall a release.
* Record the cost of the full suite in the job summary.

## Sequencing

1. Build Tier 0 and run it against `main`. It needs no secrets and no Copilot requests.
2. Build the Tier 1 fixtures and the Init and ordinary-turn cases (SQ-01 to SQ-19). Run against `main` until green — that is the baseline.
3. Add the consumption-integrity group (CON-01 to CON-44) next. Most of it is arithmetic over files already on disk, so it is nearly as deterministic as Tier 0 while catching a class of defect Tier 0 cannot see. CON-30 to CON-36 need a multi-turn fixture, so build that fixture once and reuse it.
4. Add routing and role selection (RTE) and profile seeding (PRF). PRF is cheap and fully deterministic after Init. RTE-30 to RTE-41 are the methodology cases and are the strongest evidence that the refactor preserved the squad's character.
5. Add the promotion, entrypoint, and gate cases. Promotion is the highest-value remaining group because it moves state.
6. Merge PR #70, then run the whole suite against `v0.16.0-pre`. Triage every difference against the intended-deltas table.
7. Add an autopilot scenario. It is the most expensive case in the suite and the only one that would see the failure class `0.16.0` shipped: a run that claims ten stages and leaves no `history/<agent>.md` behind any of them. This is also the only place that can exercise Scribe hand-off pipelining as a live dispatch — a host that can issue parallel subagent dispatches, running through the barrier list at GATE-22 to GATE-28 — rather than as Tier 0's static wording pins.
8. Capture the Tier 2 golden baselines from a release known to be good. Until a baseline exists per scenario, Tier 2 reports `unbaselined` and scores nothing, which is the state every release up to and including `v0.16.0` shipped in.
9. Reconsider wiring the suite into the release workflow, against the conditions in *Why the release gate is Tier 0 only*. Not before them.

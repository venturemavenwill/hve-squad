# Scribe Cold Section: Init, Seeding, and Repository Memory

Read this file only when the turn's payload is one of: an **initialization** payload (Payload-to-Step Map Step 3), a **memory** payload (Step 4), or the deliverable-root rebasing sub-step of a **promotion** or **expansion** payload (Steps 10–11, which cross-reference *Initialization and Deliverable Roots* below for the rebasing rule). Every other turn skips this file entirely — see the Cold-File Dispatch Table in [scribe-procedure.md](scribe-procedure.md).

### Initialization and Deliverable Roots

Create `team.md` from the coordinator-confirmed roster — the chosen profile's members, not the full cast catalog — and `routing.md` from the default routing rules filtered to that roster, dropping any routing row whose role is not on the seeded team. Always include the `scribe` role. Include the `Member Name` column whenever the coordinator supplies names, leaving cells empty for unnamed roles; two rows sharing a `Role` are legal only when each has a unique `Member Name`. Seed the `Selection Cue` cell for every row, using `—` where the role has no alternates: the cast catalog is canonical in `references/roster-catalog.md`, a reference file that loads only when a role's Skill Reference Contract calls for it, so a roster listing alternates without their condition leaves the coordinator to guess which one applies. Both files use replace semantics — write them only when missing or on an explicit refresh.

**Seed the whole state tree, including both consumption files.** Init creates `team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `notifications.md`, `state.json`, `history/`, **`consumption.md`**, and **`consumption-rates.md`** — the ledger from its own template in [consumption.md](consumption.md) at its seed state, and the rate table from the cold [consumption-rates-template.md](consumption-rates-template.md) at current rates. With `pwsh` 7+ seed the rate table by running `scripts/Initialize-SquadConsumptionRates.ps1 -SquadRoot <squadRoot>` rather than composing it (add `-Reseed` on a refresh); copy the template block verbatim only when no shell or `pwsh` 7+ is available. If the script refuses because a malformed operator row would be deleted, surface its message in the confirmation and leave the file as it is. They are squad state like every other file here, not artifacts that appear once someone happens to write a cost. Leaving them to be created lazily by the first consumption write is how a run reaches turn nine with a populated `history/` and no ledger at all: the rate table is the only source of token rates, so a Scribe that finds it missing cannot price a dispatch, and the block it cannot write takes the history append down with it.

**Seed `history/` as an empty directory.** Init creates no file inside it — not even a header-only one, and not for roster members it expects to dispatch later. A history file is the proof that agent ran, so pre-creating one per roster row makes an undispatched role indistinguishable from a dispatched one and leaves the ledger rewrite reading files that record nothing. Each file is created with its header at the moment its first entry is appended.

**Write the `notify` object and the Init decision, both of them.** `state.json` carries `notify` from the answer the coordinator captured; when the user declined, that is `approvalChannel: in-chat` with `enabled: false`, which is a recorded answer rather than an absent key. A run in `autonomous` or `autopilot` mode with no `notify` object has no way to reach the person its gates are waiting on. The Init decision entry records the roster's provenance — the profile plus any applied packs, or `custom` — because without it nothing in the state explains why this roster exists, and a later turn re-deriving it is guessing.

**Resolve each row's `Deliverable Root` against the `squadRoot` in hand before writing it.** The lookup table in *Deliverable Roots* (`squad-roster.instructions.md`) states roots relative to `squadRoot`, so seeding a sub-squad writes `members/<name>/plans/` into the `lead` row, not `.copilot-tracking/plans/`. Copying the table's literal paths into a sub-squad roster points every role at the repository root and puts its whole run outside its own sub-squad. `docs/` and `outputs/` are the two exceptions and are written unprefixed at every root.

**On a refresh, preserve every `Deliverable Root` cell already present.** The column is consumer-editable and the roster is the running value the coordinator dispatches against, so a refresh reseeds a root only for a role whose row it is adding. Rewriting an existing cell back to the default silently redirects a role the user deliberately pointed elsewhere.

**Write the model-routing mode and `Model` column exactly as handed over.** When the payload carries a routing mode (`ranked` or `manual`), write the single line `Model routing: <mode>` directly beneath `team.md`'s H1, and a `Model` column between `Model Tier` and `Deliverable Root` holding each role's Model ID as supplied — one lowercase id per cell, never a display name, and empty for a role the payload leaves unset. On a routing refresh, change only that line and the `Model` cells the payload names, preserving every other cell and row. When the mode is `off`, remove both the line and the column, and list the removed picks in the same turn's decision entry so a later switch back to `manual` can offer them. Record every mode change and every `manual` pick in a decision entry; a ranked readout refresh needs only the `state.json` advance. See `model-routing.md` for what each mode means; the Scribe never ranks or picks a model itself.

### Repository Memory and Learning Promotion

Write role-scoped notes to `/memories/repo/squad-<agent>.md` with the memory tool. Repository memory survives across conversations, so durable squad facts — conventions a role discovered, recurring routing choices — belong here rather than in the decision log.

When a learning is broadly applicable beyond this consumer, the Scribe may surface a sanitized promotion candidate and point the user to the promotion paths in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or to `/squad-learn`. The candidate may target the upstream package or the organization's tenant-internal repository, based on how far the learning should travel. This is a suggestion only: the Scribe writes nothing outside consumer-local `/memories/repo/` memory and never edits a shipped or tenant playbook.

# Squad Consumption Ledger

## consumption.md

Scribe-aggregated ledger of squad members, the model each consumed, and estimated AI-credit cost; this is the common "members and credits" readme. Uses replace semantics: the Scribe rewrites it each turn, mirrors roster order, and recomputes the run total and the comparison line from `consumption-rates.md`. Every figure is an estimate, because no per-dispatch token telemetry exists (the runtime exposes only the per-user aggregate `ai_credits_used`); token counts are estimated and cost and credits are derived, never billed.

The ledger is split into two narrower tables that both key on `Role` — one **Attribution** table (who ran, on what model) and one **Usage & Cost** table (what it cost) — instead of one 15-column table, because a table wide enough to need horizontal scrolling defeats the point of a ledger a consumer should be able to read at a glance.

Replace semantics govern the file, not the rows. Every rewrite is derived from the full set of per-dispatch consumption blocks recorded in `history/*.md` for the run, summed per role, so a role dispatched early keeps its row for the rest of the run and a role dispatched repeatedly holds one summed row. A rewrite that reflects only the current turn's dispatches produces a ledger that adds up correctly and is still wrong.

> Basis: estimated. No per-dispatch token telemetry exists; the runtime exposes only the per-user aggregate `ai_credits_used` via the Copilot usage-metrics REST API. `Model` is resolved per *Model Attribution* in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md` and is never invented — `unknown` where it could not be resolved. `Model Source` is `cli-pinned`, `operator-declared`, `dispatch-reported`, `agent-pinned`, `session-inherited`, or `unresolved`; an `agent-pinned` row legitimately differs from the session model. `Priced As` is the rate row used and differs from `Model` only on a fallback. `Turns` is the estimated internal tool-loop turn count, because a dispatch is many model calls and not one; it accumulates across a role's blocks exactly as the token columns do, so a role dispatched twice at `15` and `4` carries `19`. The two tables share the same `Role` order so a row in one lines up with the same row in the other. Token rates and the dispatch-size estimator come from `consumption-rates.md` (observed <date>). Calibration factor <factor> (<observations> reconciled run(s)). 1 AI credit = $0.01 USD.
>
> The `history/<file> — <n> block(s) — identities: <hash>,<hash>,...` line above each file's derivation is not decoration: it is the ledger's own record of which `###` entries it has already folded in, one short deterministic hash per entry in file order. A rewrite that finds this run's recorded identities are not an ordered prefix of the file's current identities — same count but different hashes, or fewer current entries than recorded — means an entry was overwritten, reordered, or removed since the last rewrite rather than only appended to, and `Measure-SquadLedger.ps1 -Check` (or render mode) refuses rather than silently accepting it. A pre-existing ledger with no recorded identities at all (an older-format entry) only warns when checked plainly; it never fails on that account alone. But the Scribe's own post-write self-check always runs `-Check` together with `-ExpectedHistoryCounts` (*scribe-procedure.md*'s Write-Completeness Self-Check Step 3), and in that combination a Derivation missing identities entirely, or missing them for only some of the touched files (a partial paste), FAILS instead of warning — that call always follows a fresh write, so a missing or partial paste there is this run's own defect, never a genuinely old ledger.

## Unit Economics (value)

| Measure                               | Value | Label     |
| ------------------------------------- | ----- | --------- |
| Deliverables produced                 | <n>   | derived   |
| Accepted by an independent review     | <n>   | derived   |
| Rejected                              | <n>   | derived   |
| Unreviewed                            | <n>   | derived   |
| Dispatches (excluding Scribe)         | <n>   | derived   |
| Rework dispatches                     | <n>   | derived   |
| First-pass yield                      | <pct> | derived   |
| Est. credits per accepted deliverable | <n>   | estimated |
| Rework share of est. credits          | <pct> | estimated |
| Orchestration share of est. credits   | <pct> | estimated |

Value is counted only for deliverables an independent review-class verdict accepted; a produced but unaccepted deliverable adds cost and no value. Compare runs only for like work, using medians of several runs. Source: FinOps Foundation unit-economics KPIs (cost per unit of value, error and retry waste).

## Cost Comparison (illustrative)

This run consumed an estimated **$<squad-cost> (~<squad-credits> AI credits)** across <n> specialized agents, routing read-heavy roles to lightweight models and reserving high-output reasoning models only where needed. Reproducing the same outcome by manually prompting <baseline-model> across roughly <iterations> iterate-and-test turns, each priced through the same dispatch-size estimator, is estimated at **$<manual-cost> (~<manual-credits> AI credits)** — a saving of about **<savings-pct>%**.

<optional per-phase or per-dispatch breakdown, added below the comparison and never in place of it>

> Estimates only. Token rates change. See `consumption-rates.md` for current rates, the dispatch-size estimator, and the calibration methodology. Token counts and iteration counts are illustrative, not guarantees.
````

## consumption-rates.md

Single maintainable rate table that isolates volatile per-model token pricing from agent logic, plus the dispatch-size estimator and the calibration factor. Uses replace semantics. The Scribe seeds it from the template in [consumption-rates-template.md](consumption-rates-template.md) — a **cold** file, read only on initialization or at a Step 7.1 reseed, never on an ordinary decision or history dispatch — when the file is missing **or when the existing file does not carry the required sections** (see the Scribe's Step 7 shape check: a per-model rate table with `Input`, `Cached`, `Cache write`, and `Output` columns, a tier-fallback table, a dispatch-size estimator, and a calibration block), so a hand-edited or drifted table can never silently degrade every estimate. Because only this file holds token rates, a price change updates one table and never touches an agent prompt. Coordinators' Cost Preflight prices from the squad root's own `consumption-rates.md`, never from the template file.

## Orchestration overhead

The coordinator's own turns and each Scribe write consume tokens too, and they are dispatches the ledger would otherwise never see. Record them as a single `orchestration` row per run: one coordinator turn per dispatch round at the coordinator's own model, plus one `Scribe state write` class dispatch per Scribe hand-off.

The row is an aggregate, not the storage. Each turn's orchestration figures are appended as a `#### Consumption — Orchestration` block to `history/Squad Scribe.md`, and the row is the sum of every such block recorded for the run. A figure that lives only in the turn's payload cannot be read back, so the row resets to the current turn on the next rewrite and the run under-reports its own overhead by every turn that came before.

## Cost formula

Cost is derived **once per ledger row**, never in a history block. Sum the role's blocks into the four token columns, then take the rates from the row `priced_as` names in `consumption-rates.md`:

```text
raw_cost_usd = ( input_tokens       × input_rate
               + cached_tokens      × cached_rate
               + cache_write_tokens × cache_write_rate
               + output_tokens      × output_rate ) / 1e6
est_cost_usd = raw_cost_usd × calibration_factor
est_credits  = est_cost_usd / 0.01
```

A rate is a property of the model, so it belongs to the one file that lists models. Copying it into every block restates the same fact once per dispatch and gives it that many chances to be restated wrong, and a cost stored beside its own inputs is a second copy of a number the inputs already determine. `calibration_factor` is read from the squad root's own `consumption-rates.md` — its calibration block and reconciliation procedure are documented in the template at [consumption-rates-template.md](consumption-rates-template.md), read only on initialization or a Step 7.1 reseed.

## Cost Preflight

`cost-ceiling=$X` is a model-spend admission control, not a billing quote and not an Azure workload budget. Initialization is outside Cost Preflight: the confirmed bootstrap Scribe dispatch seeds the files required for estimation and is recorded as setup spend without consuming a ceiling slot. After initialization completes, the coordinator evaluates the original request before its first work child or Scribe handoff, then repeats the evaluation before every later dispatch round. Receiving and classifying the request already consumes the current coordinator turn, so the manifest includes that turn; no preflight can avoid the model call needed to read the request.

Resolve the effective ceiling before building the manifest:

1. A supplied finite positive number sets or replaces the ceiling for the active run.
2. The literal `cost-ceiling=unset` explicitly removes the ceiling. Persist the exact `not-requested` object, preserving accumulated cost totals, and continue without cost-based admission.
3. When the argument is omitted, inherit the latest finite positive `ceilingUsd` only if its non-empty Cost Preflight `runId` matches the active run id. Omission never means removal.
4. When the active run id differs, or no prior positive ceiling exists, omission means no ceiling for the new run and persists `not-requested`.

Resolve the active run id before this decision from the run the coordinator is continuing or creating. A new autopilot topic, Watch event, or federation meta-run gets a new id; a later request that resumes that recorded run keeps its id. Never copy a ceiling across run ids.

The coordinator persists every round only through `scripts/Set-SquadCostPreflight.ps1`, per *Cost Preflight Procedure* step 3 in `references/gates-and-modes.md`: the compact object is its `-PreflightJson` and the readable record below is its `-DecisionText`.

An effectively unset ceiling records `not-requested` and preserves existing behavior. A state whose `currentRun.costPreflight` is absent reads as `not-requested` already: with no ceiling, write nothing and dispatch no Scribe for it (`Set-SquadCostPreflight.ps1` adds the object when a later ceiling is written, and `Write-SquadHandoff.ps1` adds the same default). A configured ceiling must be a finite positive USD number. The configured decisions are `within-ceiling`, `over-ceiling`, `approved-over-ceiling`, and `cannot-confirm`. `within-ceiling` and `approved-over-ceiling` permit only the exact next-dispatch set recorded by their round; the latter is created only by the explicit approval transition below.

### Planned-dispatch manifest

Build the complete manifest through the selected mode boundary before pricing it:

1. Add one row for every fixed stage role, every maximum conditional remediation or validation slot, each coordinator dispatch round, and each later Scribe handoff. Include orchestration once; never assume it is free.
2. For autonomous mode, include the initial council, implementation, and both permitted revalidation cycles. For autopilot, include applicable intake plus both remediation attempts, research, plan, council, implementation, both revalidation cycles, review, and final validation. Include an accepted discovery depth before intake. For federation autopilot, include every selected inner manifest plus federation coordinator and root-writer orchestration.
3. Before a Plan artifact identifies deliverable fan-out, reserve every artifact-owning roster role other than `researcher`, `lead`, and `tester`. If that conservative set cannot be enumerated, return `cannot-confirm`. After Plan, replace it with the exact fan-out and recalculate before dispatch.
4. Assign exactly one dispatch class to every row: research and discovery use `Research / file survey`; plan and remediation use `Plan / synthesis`; implementation and artifact-producing roles use `Implement / edit loop`; review and intake validation use `Review / verification`; council roles use `Council member opinion`; Scribe uses `Scribe state write`; coordinator rounds use `Lookup / single-file read`. An unmapped stage makes the manifest incomplete and returns `cannot-confirm`.
5. Use the class row's exact `Internal turns`, `Base context`, `Growth/turn`, and `Output/turn` values unless a larger bound is already known before dispatch. Post-dispatch reports refine the ledger, never the preflight that admitted that dispatch.
6. Resolve pricing only from facts knowable before dispatch. For an unpinned agent under a fixed session model, use that model's row. For a pinned agent under a fixed session model, price the more expensive of the pin and session model so an entitlement fallback cannot make the reservation cheaper. Include an operator-declared candidate the same way. `auto`, an unresolved model, a missing candidate rate, or an invalid rate table is low confidence and cannot admit work. When `routing=ranked` or `routing=manual` resolved a routed id for the role, price the rate row whose `Model ID` matches it instead, per `model-routing.md`'s Cost Preflight Pricing.

Every readable Cost Preflight record uses this table shape. `Projected Cost` is the calibrated point estimate before the policy reserve; row calculations retain full precision.

| Slot | Stage | Role | Count | Dispatch Class | Pricing Basis | Internal Turns | Base Context | Growth/Turn | Output/Turn | Projected Cost |
|------|-------|------|------:|----------------|---------------|---------------:|-------------:|------------:|------------:|---------------:|
| <id> | <stage> | <role> | <n> | <class> | <model or max-candidate set> | <turns> | <tokens> | <tokens> | <tokens> | <usd> |

### Calculation and confidence

Calculate rows through the existing dispatch-size and cost formulas. Apply the eligible `calibration_factor` exactly once to each unrounded row cost, then sum unrounded row values:

```text
evaluated_spend_usd = currentRun.estCostUsd + pending_usd
remaining_usd       = max(0, ceiling_usd - evaluated_spend_usd)
projected_cost_usd  = sum(unrounded calibrated manifest row costs)
reserve_multiplier  = 3.0
admission_cost_usd  = projected_cost_usd * reserve_multiplier
```

The factor-of-three reserve matches the repository's material uncertainty band for estimated ledger figures. It is a policy reserve, not a statistical confidence interval. Round displayed and persisted totals to four decimal places only after all rows are summed; never sum rounded display values.

**Pending reservation.** `pending_usd` is `0` whenever every child that has returned also has a verified Scribe hand-off, which is always the case without autopilot hand-off pipelining. Under pipelining, the round that admits stage N+1 runs after stage N's child has returned but before stage N's Scribe hand-off is dispatched, so `currentRun.estCostUsd` does not yet include stage N. For each such returned-but-unrecorded child slot, add its admitted unrounded `Projected Cost` times `reserve_multiplier` to `pending_usd`. The persisted `evaluatedSpendUsd` is `evaluated_spend_usd`, so `remainingUsd = ceilingUsd - evaluatedSpendUsd` still holds. Once that hand-off verifies, the recorded ledger figure replaces the reservation at the next round, which bounds any estimate drift to one stage. Never subtract a reservation from recorded spend or carry it into `currentRun.estCostUsd`.

Cost Preflight confidence is `medium` only when all of these are true:

* The configured ceiling is finite and positive.
* The manifest is complete through the selected mode boundary.
* Every candidate model is fixed before dispatch and has a current rate row.
* The rate table passes its shape check.
* Calibration is eligible for the current `Observed-on` value and estimator revision.

Otherwise confidence is `low`. The preflight never reports `high`, because future token use remains estimated even after calibration.

Apply the decision in this order:

1. With no ceiling, record `not-requested` and do not gate existing behavior.
2. With an invalid ceiling or low confidence, record `cannot-confirm` and fire the Risk Gate.
3. When accumulated estimated spend is at or above the ceiling, record `over-ceiling` with no permitted set and stop. This terminal boundary cannot be approved.
4. With medium confidence and `admission_cost_usd > remaining_usd`, record `over-ceiling` with no permitted set. Present the ceiling, accumulated estimated spend, remaining amount, projected remaining-demand cost, conservative admission cost, and the one-dispatch-unit overshoot limitation, then ask the user to stop or proceed under the unchanged ceiling.
5. Otherwise record `within-ceiling` and permit only that round's named next-dispatch set.

When the user chooses proceed, preserve the `over-ceiling` record and append a new round with a new round id. Copy its run id, ceiling, evaluated spend, demand rows, pricing inputs, costs, confidence, and basis; add `Approved From` and `Approval Ref` to the readable record; set its decision to `approved-over-ceiling`; and permit one sequential dispatch unit. A dispatch unit is one substantive child plus the mandatory Scribe handoff that records it. The Scribe handoff completes even when that child's estimated cost reaches or crosses the ceiling, because omitting it would hide the spend that triggered the stop. Federation uses one sub-squad plus its root-writer handoff as the unit. Do not launch a parallel set from an approved-over-ceiling round.

The approval remains valid for later rounds only while the run id and ceiling are unchanged, confidence remains medium, every remaining demand row is unchanged and belongs to the approved manifest, and the demand set only shrinks. Under those conditions, append a fresh `approved-over-ceiling` round for the next sequential unit without asking again. A changed ceiling, expanded or repriced demand, different model input, low confidence, or missing approval provenance requires a new gate; `cannot-confirm` is never approvable.

Immediately before each dispatch unit, read `currentRun.estCostUsd` again and add any pending reservation. When that evaluated spend is at or above `ceilingUsd`, append the terminal `over-ceiling` round, permit no slot, and stop. An in-flight unit cannot be interrupted, so its final recorded estimate may cross the ceiling; no later substantive child starts. If later routing expands beyond the approved manifest, stop before dispatch and recalculate.

### Worked single-squad example

This example uses the class inputs above, Claude Sonnet 4.6 for coordinator and research, Claude Haiku 4.5 for Scribe, and an eligible calibration factor of `1.20`:

```text
coordinator  13800 x 3.00 +  55200 x 0.30 + 26000 x 3.75 +  2400 x 15.00 =  191460 / 1e6 x 1.20 = 0.229752
researcher  148800 x 3.00 + 595200 x 0.30 + 84000 x 3.75 + 15000 x 15.00 = 1164960 / 1e6 x 1.20 = 1.397952
scribe       15600 x 1.00 +  62400 x 0.10 + 24000 x 1.25 +  3200 x  5.00 =   67840 / 1e6 x 1.20 = 0.081408
                                           projected = 1.709112
                                         admission x3.0 = 5.127336
```

With `ceilingUsd=10.0000` and `currentRun.estCostUsd=0.5000`, `remainingUsd=9.5000`. The persisted point estimate is `1.7091`, admission cost is `5.1273`, and the decision is `within-ceiling` at medium confidence.

### Worked federation example

Federation admission sums already reserved inner-run costs and a separately priced federation meta-orchestration reservation:

```text
product inner admission       = 5.127336
azure inner admission         = 3.200000
federation meta admission     = 0.900000
federation admission total    = 9.227336
remaining (12.0000 - 1.0000)  = 11.000000
decision                      = within-ceiling
```

The federation readable table displays all three terms. Federation `currentRun.estCostUsd` adds realized inner-ledger totals plus the unrounded calibrated projected cost of each completed federation coordinator or root-writer slot exactly once. A meta slot is completed only when its id appears in a federation history transition; future slots stay reserved in `admissionCostUsd`, and duplicate references do not add cost again. The sum of inner ledgers alone is never treated as the whole model spend.

## Comparison methodology (token terms)

* `squad_cost = sum over dispatched roles of est_cost_usd`
* `manual_baseline = expected_iterations × baseline_model_cost_per_turn`, where a manual turn is itself priced through the dispatch-size estimator rather than as a single call
* `savings_pct = 1 - (squad_cost / manual_baseline)`

All values above are labeled estimated, and token counts are estimated because the coordinator never sees per-dispatch telemetry.

## Observed usage (host-reported)

The estimates stay; observed usage sits beside them. When the coordinator has `pwsh` 7+, its `ledgerCommand` carries `-SessionLog auto`, and `Measure-SquadLedger.ps1` reads the host's own session log (`events.jsonl` under `$COPILOT_HOME/session-state/<session id>/`, written by the Copilot CLI and the VS Code agent host) for the session whose workspace is this repository. It writes an `## Observed Usage (host-reported)` section into `consumption.md`, before `## Cost Comparison`, and replaces it on every later rewrite:

* **Per agent:** dispatches, the model the host actually ran, the model the history blocks record, whether the two match, real total tokens, the estimated tokens beside them, minutes, and a blended USD figure. A `no` in the match column, also printed as a warning, is the evidence for an *Identity mismatch* in `model-routing.md`: an id passed that differs from the routed cell, or a dispatch that omitted `model` and ran on the session model.
* **Session total:** the host's billed AI units for the whole chat session, coordinator included, read from the last `session.usage_checkpoint`. It converts at 0.01 USD per unit, the same convention as 1 AI credit. The coordinator's own turns appear only here.
* **Without HVE Squad:** the routed run's observed tokens, roles plus Scribe at their real models, compared with the same role tokens run on one model and no Scribe. The baseline defaults to the most expensive model by blended rate that any role ran on; `-BaselineModel` overrides it.

```text
blended_rate(model) = 0.20 × input + 0.80 × cached + 0.08 × cache_write + 0.02 × output   (model-catalog.md)
with_squad_usd      = Σ over observed dispatches of total_tokens × blended_rate(observed model) / 1e6
without_squad_usd   = Σ over observed role dispatches of total_tokens × blended_rate(baseline) / 1e6
difference_pct      = (without_squad_usd − with_squad_usd) / without_squad_usd
```

The host reports one token total per dispatch, never the input, cached, and output split, so both sides use the same blended mix. Neither side includes coordinator turns, and the single-model side adds no extra context growth or rework, so it is a floor for that scenario rather than a forecast. A sub-squad root counts only dispatches whose prompt names its `members/<name>/` root. Without a matching session log the section is omitted and the estimates stand alone.

## Unit economics (value)

`Measure-SquadLedger.ps1 -Write` writes the `## Unit Economics (value)` section (replacing it on every rewrite, before `## Observed Usage (host-reported)` or `## Cost Comparison`); it is never hand-authored, and `-Check` ignores it. It divides cost by value: a deliverable counts only when the latest covering review-class entry (same `Turn` and `Workstream`) reads pass, pass-with-findings, or approved in its `Outcome`; fail, rejected, or blocked marks it rejected, and no covering review leaves it unreviewed. A rework dispatch is a non-Scribe entry whose agent and deliverable already appeared in an earlier entry; first-pass yield is the accepted deliverables with none. With a session log, a `measured` row divides the host-billed credits by the accepted count.

## Manual Ledger Checks

Moved from `scribe-procedure.md` Consumption Accounting Step 7 so the hot core stays within its size budget; this file is read on every history turn. A script hand-off (`Write-SquadHandoff.ps1`) writes the squad figure and, in an existing comparison, recomputes the squad cost, credits, and saving percentage from its stated baseline. It re-seeds a `consumption.md` that lacks the ledger sections from the template above, and appends the template's `## Cost Comparison (illustrative)` section with the squad-figure line when the ledger has none, so the Scribe is never dispatched for it. It treats a `state.json` without `currentRun.costPreflight` as the unset default (1.3 becomes 1.4); a configured ceiling still goes to the Scribe.

**The Cost Comparison section is required, and it names three figures**: what this run cost, what the manual baseline would have cost, and the saving as a percentage. When `consumption.md` has an *Observed Usage* section, take all three from its billed total and *Without HVE Squad* table instead. Otherwise, derive the baseline per *Comparison methodology* — `expected_iterations × baseline_model_cost_per_turn`, with a manual turn priced through the same dispatch-size estimator — and state the iteration count and the baseline model the section assumed, so a reader can disagree with the assumption rather than only with the answer. A per-turn or per-phase breakdown may be added below it and never in place of it. Carry the estimates-only disclaimer, the calibration factor, and the observation count on both the ledger and the comparison. When any row resolved to `unknown`, say so rather than presenting a confident-looking model name.

**Compute the total by adding the rows just written, column by column — never by estimating it.** Then verify: each column of the total row equals the sum of that column's rows, and the figure quoted in the comparison prose is the *same number* as the table's total. A ledger whose total disagrees with its own rows, or whose prose quotes a different total than its table, is self-refuting.

# Squad Reference Index

Read this file first, then read only the reference files your role names in its Skill Reference Contract. A reference file is loaded whole, so reading one you do not need costs attention you need elsewhere.

## Which file for which job

| File                                               | Read it when                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [profiles-and-packs.md](profiles-and-packs.md)     | Seeding or amending a roster: profile choice, packs, which roles exist    |
| [roster-catalog.md](roster-catalog.md)             | Casting a role for the first time, recasting after an HVE Core upgrade, applying or registering a pack's external agents, resolving an external role, or assembling a custom roster |
| [operating-procedure.md](operating-procedure.md)   | Running a turn: Init, Route, ledger reconciliation, Decide, Handoff       |
| [gates-and-modes.md](gates-and-modes.md)           | Gates — discovery, intake, council, implementation — and autonomy modes   |
| [federation.md](federation.md)                     | The squad root is a federation: layout, precedence, federation modes      |
| [scribe-procedure.md](scribe-procedure.md)         | Writing squad state, Scribe only: the Non-Negotiable Rules, every payload-to-step rule, the Cold-File Dispatch Table, and the Write-Completeness Self-Check |
| [entry-schemas.md](entry-schemas.md)               | Any ordinary write turn: `decisions.md` base shape, `history/<agent>.md`, state.json |
| [scribe-payload-template.md](scribe-payload-template.md) | Filling or reading the Scribe hand-off payload: field order, and the byte-stable-prefix / volatile-tail section order both coordinators follow |
| [scribe-cold-init-and-seeding.md](scribe-cold-init-and-seeding.md) | Scribe only, initialization or memory payload: the full state-tree seed and Repository Memory and Learning Promotion |
| [scribe-cold-federation.md](scribe-cold-federation.md) | Scribe only, promotion, expansion, or a federation-level autopilot-run-summary or history payload |
| [scribe-cold-gates-and-verdicts.md](scribe-cold-gates-and-verdicts.md) | Scribe only, a Council/Intake/Discovery Verdict, an autonomous-loop summary, a single-squad autopilot-run summary, or a notification write |
| [seed-templates.md](seed-templates.md)             | Stamping first-run state, Init only: `team.md` and `routing.md`           |
| [consumption.md](consumption.md)                   | Recording or estimating cost: ledger templates, the estimator, and Cost Preflight |
| [consumption-rates-template.md](consumption-rates-template.md) | Scribe only, initialization or a Step 7.1 reseed: the cold seed template for `consumption-rates.md` |
| [model-catalog.md](model-catalog.md)               | Routing a dispatch to a specific model: declared capability, pricing, and host-availability precedence |
| [model-routing.md](model-routing.md)               | Applying `routing=` (off, ranked, economy, manual): modes, the Model column, fit ranking, floors, and identity bullets |
| [federation-templates.md](federation-templates.md) | Creating or expanding a federation: registry, meta-routing, root files    |

The Scribe reads `00-index.md`, `scribe-procedure.md`, `entry-schemas.md`, and `scribe-payload-template.md` on every turn — this hot core replaced a heavier unconditional set so the common case reads less — and reads every other file above, including the three `scribe-cold-*.md` files, only when the turn's payload calls for it per the Cold-File Dispatch Table in `scribe-procedure.md`. The coordinators read `seed-templates.md` and `federation-templates.md` only to verify deliverable roots during Init or a federation change, and fill `scribe-payload-template.md` on every hand-off.

## Companion instruction files

The `squad` skill complements eleven instruction files that auto-apply when squad state is touched. Their `applyTo` globs only fire in a host that loads modular instructions, so a rule that must hold unconditionally belongs in a reference file above, not only here.

* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md` — roster schema, `### Dispatchability`, Casting Rules, and Squad Profiles/Packs; the Cast Catalog and External Cast are canonical in `references/roster-catalog.md`.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md` — routing table and escalation rules.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-discovery-gate.instructions.md` — opt-in pre-work discovery gate, scoped to the `product` and `full` profiles, that brainstorms a brief when a turn has no requirement or input artifact to build on, with depth tiers, an offer-once rule, an unattended-run prohibition, and the Discovery Verdict schema.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-intake-gate.instructions.md` — conditional pre-work intake gate that validates requirement and input artifacts before planning or implementation, with a bounded auto-remediation loop and the Intake Readiness Verdict schema.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md` — state layout, single-writer ownership, and tool-to-mechanism mapping.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-council.instructions.md` — pre-implementation council protocol with parallel dispatch, most-restrictive-wins synthesis, and the Council Verdict schema.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autonomous.instructions.md` — opt-in `auto-validated` autonomy tier with a bounded re-validation loop, divergence detection, and mandatory escalation triggers.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md` — opt-in `mode=autopilot` full pipeline (research→plan→implement→review) with Human Gates only on impactful actions and final-outcome validation.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md` — user-contact capture at squad build time and the delivery-agnostic notification (ping) contract per mode.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md` — event-driven Watch Mode (DR-01) trigger contract: opt-in gates, event-to-intent map, injection-safe payloads, the event-scoped sub-squad bootstrap, and the pull-request deliverable.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md` — opt-in federation of named sub-squads under one repo: the parameterized squad root, the registry (`federation.md`) and meta-routing (`meta-routing.md`) schemas, detection precedence, and the two-level single-writer rule.
* `.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md` — opt-in federation-level autopilot: the meta-pipeline (`mode=autopilot` with no `squad=` target) that orders sub-squad autopilot runs under one set of federation gates, an aggregate cost ceiling, and one consolidated final-outcome validation.

# Scribe Payload Template

This is the one payload shape both coordinators fill at hand-off, in this section order. The fixed top text never changes, keeping a host's prompt cache warm; only the tail differs.

**Ordering is prose-only, never a JSON-field reorder.** Every JSON object below, most importantly the ten-field `#### Consumption` block, keeps the field order fixed in [entry-schemas.md](entry-schemas.md) and [scribe-procedure.md](scribe-procedure.md) Non-Negotiable Rules, wherever it sits in this template.

## 1. Invariant Instructions (Byte-Stable — Fill Nothing Here)

Read, do not edit, this section on every dispatch; it is the stable prefix a cache-aware host reuses.

### 1.1 Payload Type

State exactly one payload type from the Payload-to-Step Map in [scribe-procedure.md](scribe-procedure.md): `decision`, `history`, `initialization`, `memory`, `Council Verdict`, `autonomous-loop summary`, `autopilot-run summary`, `Intake Readiness Verdict`, `promotion`, `expansion`, or `Discovery Verdict`. The Scribe uses this single field, not the shape of the data below it, to decide which cold file(s) the Cold-File Dispatch Table names — never guess a type from context.

### 1.2 Location

State the resolved `squadRoot` this payload targets. The default `.copilot-tracking/squad/` preserves single-squad behavior; a federation sub-squad resolves to `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`; a federation-level payload resolves to the federation root. Every path the Scribe writes is relative to this value.

### 1.3 Run Identity

State `run id`, `turn`, `stage` (when the run is autopilot or autonomous), and a `timestamp` in the format the target entry heading uses. These four identify the run and turn and are carried into every entry, decision, and ledger row this dispatch writes.

### 1.4 History Records (When Payload Type Is `history`)

For each dispatch this turn recorded, supply: the agent's `name:` frontmatter value verbatim (never slugified, never lowercased), the scoped request it received, its deliverable path and one-line outcome, and — when a ceiling is configured — its Cost Preflight Decision Ref and permitted slot. Each history record's consumption JSON follows immediately, in the fixed field order from [entry-schemas.md](entry-schemas.md): `model`, `model_source`, `priced_as`, `model_tier`, `internal_turns`, `input_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `basis`. Supply one consumption object per history record — never one without the other, per the `per-dispatch-history-and-consumption` rule. Fill `model`/`model_source` from what the coordinator knows, never the Scribe's guess: the agent's frontmatter pin (`agent-pinned`), the dispatch's passed `model` (`cli-pinned`), or the host-reported one (`dispatch-reported`). Only the Scribe's own history entry uses its pin (`Claude Haiku 4.5`, `agent-pinned`); the coordinator's orchestration share is priced at its session model. `priced_as` is a rate-row name, never `orchestration-overhead`; `orchestration` is never a `model_source`.

When a routing policy or a bounded pick resolved this dispatch's model, also supply its `routingIdentity` values (`requestedModel`, `effectiveModel`, `observedModel`, `routeRationale`) so the Scribe can render the four identity bullets `entry-schemas.md` defines. Omit `routingIdentity` entirely when no policy applied — never emit it for a no-policy dispatch.

### 1.5 Decision Entries (When Payload Type Is `decision` or a Verdict)

Supply the decision's rationale and, when architecturally significant, a note that an ADR should be captured. For a verdict payload, supply the exact schema fields the matching instruction file requires (`squad-council.instructions.md`, `squad-intake-gate.instructions.md`, or `squad-discovery-gate.instructions.md`) — never a partial schema; an incomplete verdict schema is returned as a failure note rather than written partially.

### 1.6 State Advance (Every Payload)

State the roles dispatched this turn (`activeRoles`), any escalation raised or resolved, the autonomy mode in effect, and any `sessionModel`/`modelOverrides` this turn carried. This runs last regardless of payload type, per *Advancing `state.json`* in [scribe-procedure.md](scribe-procedure.md).

### 1.7 Expected Post-Write Counts (Every Payload That Appends to `history/`)

State what the Scribe should find after writing: the number of history entries this turn is adding per agent file, and the number of consumption blocks this turn is adding. The Scribe's Write-Completeness Self-Check re-reads the files and compares its own count against these numbers before returning success — this field is what makes that check possible rather than advisory.

### 1.8 Ledger Command (Every Payload That Appends to `history/`)

When the coordinator has a shell with `pwsh` 7+, supply `ledgerCommand`: the exact `-Write` command with the installed squad skill's absolute script path, as in the YAML below. The Scribe runs it verbatim as its last write and never hand-writes `consumption.md` rows or the two `currentRun` totals when `pwsh` 7+ exists, supplied or not.

### 1.9 Script Hand-off (Coordinator, Ordinary Payloads Only)

With `pwsh` 7+, a `decision` or `history` payload is instead written by the coordinator through `scripts/Write-SquadHandoff.ps1` (no Scribe in flight; JSON keys and refusals in *Script Hand-off* in `operating-procedure.md`). Its orchestration block has no Scribe share: only the coordinator's turns at the session model, since no Scribe was dispatched.

## 2. Per-Dispatch Data (Volatile — Fill Every Turn)

Everything below this line changes turn to turn and is appended after the stable prefix above.

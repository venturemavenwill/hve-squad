## Related repositories

This repository is the source of truth. The squad also ships through two sibling repositories,
each generated from a tagged `hve-squad` release rather than maintained as a fork:

- **[hve-squad-mcp](https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad-mcp)** — an outbound MCP server that
  publishes the squad as model-invocable tools, so hosts such as Copilot Studio can call it.
  Docs: [peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad-mcp](https://peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad-mcp/)
- **[hve-squad-plugin](https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad-plugin)** — a generated,
  release-gated mirror of the squad's GitHub Copilot CLI plugin tree, published as a plugin
  marketplace. Docs: [peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad-plugin](https://peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad-plugin/)

Use this package when you want `/squad` in VS Code Copilot Chat with the full cast installed in your
repository, the plugin when you want the squad in the Copilot CLI or desktop app with no `apm install`,
and the MCP server when another host should call the squad as tools. See
[Ecosystem](https://peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad/ecosystem.html) for the full comparison.

## Quick start

The APM installation path currently requires **APM CLI 0.29.0**. A regression in APM
0.29.1 and 0.30.0 causes 11 HVE Squad dependencies to fail, so do not use an unversioned
latest installation for now. Confirm the CLI version before installing the package:

```powershell
apm --version  # must report 0.29.0
apm install "Peter-N91/hve-squad#vX.Y.z" --target copilot
```

See [Getting Started](https://peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad/getting-started.html) for pinned
APM installation commands for Windows and macOS, and
[Troubleshooting](https://peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad/troubleshooting.html) if an earlier
attempt left a partial installation.

Then invoke `/squad` in Copilot Chat:

```text
/squad request="add input validation to the login form"
```

Add an optional model-spend ceiling when you want a conservative forecast before work starts:

```text
/squad request="add input validation to the login form" cost-ceiling=10
```

Within the same run, omitting the argument preserves an active ceiling. Use
`cost-ceiling=unset` to remove it explicitly. See
[Cost admission control](https://peter-n91.github.io/hve-squad/usage.html#cost-admission-control)
for estimation, approval, stopping, and federation behavior. Fresh-squad initialization is outside
admission. Ordinary federation routing applies the ceiling independently to each selected sub-squad;
only untargeted federation autopilot uses one aggregate federation ceiling.

### Choosing models per role (`routing=`)

**Default behavior (`routing=off`):** No `model` parameter is passed to any dispatch, so each agent runs on its own frontmatter model or the session model, exactly as before this feature existed.

`routing=` has four modes. The mode is **saved in `team.md`** and stays in effect on later requests until you change it, so you pass it once:

| Mode | How each role's model is chosen | What `team.md` shows |
|------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| `off` (default) | Not chosen; the agent's own pin or the session model runs | No `Model` column |
| `ranked` | The squad picks the model that best fits the role's work, among the models your host offers | `Model routing: ranked` and a `Model` column listing each pick |
| `economy` | As `ranked`, except implementation roles get the cheapest model with a fit of 2 or better within their floor, and move once to their `ranked` pick after a failed review | `Model routing: economy` and a `Model` column listing each pick |
| `manual` | You pick, once, with suggestions pre-filled | `Model routing: manual` and a `Model` column holding your picks |

**How ranked picks are made.** Each role maps to an assignment class (`research`, `planning`, `implementation`, `review`, `council`, `intake`, `bookkeeping`). The model catalog scores every model 0–3 for each class, and the squad picks the highest fit, then the lowest blended cost, then the newest generation of the same model family. It never breaks a tie by a model's name. On the Copilot CLI the seeded roster resolves to, for example, `researcher` → `claude-opus-5.5`, `lead` → `gpt-5.6-sol`, `developer` → `gpt-5.3-codex`, `tester` → `gpt-6-sol`, `architect` → `gpt-5.5`, `intake-validator` → `claude-sonnet-5.5`, and `scribe` → `claude-haiku-4.5`.

**How manual picks are made.** When you switch to `routing=manual`, whether at squad creation or later, the coordinator asks before dispatching anything:

1. Accept the suggested model for every role (the ranked picks), or
2. choose one model per assignment class, then
3. override any individual role.

Every question lists only models **your host can run** and that meet the role's `Model Tier` floor. On the Copilot CLI and the GitHub Copilot app, that is the exact list the `task` tool advertises. VS Code does not advertise a list, so the squad offers catalog models priced at or below your session model; VS Code rejects a subagent model above the session's cost tier. If VS Code rejects a pick, you are asked again with the list VS Code reports. You can also edit a `Model` cell by hand; the squad validates it on every read.

**What a `Model` cell holds.** One exact model id from the `Model ID` column of `consumption-rates.md` (for example `claude-sonnet-5.5`). A cell below the role's floor, an unknown id, or an id containing shell or prompt metacharacters is refused and logged, never guessed. That role then falls back to its `Model Tier`, and the next interactive turn asks again.

**Precedence** (highest wins, per role):
1. `routing=manual`: the role's valid `Model` cell.
2. `routing=ranked`: the ranked pick for that role (`routing=economy`: the economy pick).
3. `tier=` or the role's `team.md` Model Tier — today's fallback, unchanged.
4. Omit the parameter — the no-policy default.

**Unevaluated models:** A model the host offers but the catalog does not carry is never ranked or suggested. You can still type it as a manual pick; it is then labelled `unevaluated` in the dispatch record.

**Which model to start the session on.** The model you pick in the chat, or pass with `--model`, runs the coordinator: it reads the roster, plans the stages, and dispatches every role. `routing=` never changes it. Start on a fixed model from the catalog's `balanced` class (the vendor's mid tier), as capable as `claude-sonnet-5.5`. Pick any model of that class your host offers, for example `claude-sonnet-5.5`, `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gemini-3.8-flash`, or `grok-4.7`; the squad skill's `references/model-catalog.md` holds the current list. A `frontier-reasoning` model adds cost to every coordinator turn without improving the work, which `ranked` already sends to frontier models where it pays off. A `fast-lightweight` model is more likely to miss required steps, such as copying the `Model` cell or sending the Scribe hand-off together with the next stage. Under `auto`, the host can switch the coordinator's model mid-run, and the ledger cannot price its share.

**Examples:**

```text
/squad request="..." routing=ranked
```
Switch to ranked selection; `team.md` gains a `Model` column showing each role's pick.

```text
/squad request="..." routing=manual
```
Switch to manual selection; you are asked for the models before the request runs, and later requests reuse your picks.

```text
/squad request="..." routing=off
```
Return to the default; the `Model` column is removed, and the decision log keeps your previous picks so switching back to `manual` can offer them again.

```text
/squad-federation squad=product routing=manual
```
Switch the `product` sub-squad to manual selection; each sub-squad keeps its own picks.

The former `models=<key>:<id>,...` input is retired. If you pass it, it is not applied, and the coordinator points you to `routing=manual`.

**Full catalog:** See `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/references/model-catalog.md`. It is a dated snapshot (retrieved 2026-09-30) with capability classes, per-class fit scores, pricing, and host-availability notes. After 90 days the catalog counts as stale, and ranking falls back to static tier pricing.

**Deterministic helper:** `.github/skills/squad/scripts/Resolve-SquadModelRoute.ps1 -SquadRoot .copilot-tracking/squad` (PowerShell 7+, read-only) prints each role's class, floor, ranked pick, and `Model` cell status. On the CLI, pass `-AvailableModels` with your host's model ids; on VS Code, pass `-SessionModel`.

**History and identity bullets:**

The squad records which model routing requested, which model actually ran (if the host substituted one), and which model the host reported. These details appear in `.copilot-tracking/squad/history/` (single squad) or `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/history/` (federation) only while routing is `ranked`, `economy`, or `manual`. See the identity bullets in those history files for: Requested model, Effective model, Observed model, and Route rationale.

**Important notes:**

- **Estimates, not bills** — Token counts and cost figures are estimated from a dispatch-size model, not from runtime telemetry. Premium-request multipliers and long-context pricing come from the catalog and are estimates. See `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/references/model-catalog.md` and `consumption-rates.md` for methodology.
- **Availability sources** — The catalog cites three GitHub official documentation pages (fetched at catalog build time): Supported AI models, Models and pricing, and AI model comparison. URLs are listed in the catalog header.

**Optional ledger check:**

After a squad run, you can verify the consumed and estimated consumption against the recorded history using the read-only script:

```powershell
.github/skills/squad/scripts/Measure-SquadLedger.ps1 -SquadRoot .copilot-tracking/squad -Check
```

Or, for a sub-squad in a federation:

```powershell
.github/skills/squad/scripts/Measure-SquadLedger.ps1 -SquadRoot .copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name> -Check
```

This script (PowerShell 7+) validates that every recorded dispatch has a consumption block, that token counts and cost derivations round-trip correctly, and that the aggregated ledger totals match the sum of all recorded history entries. The `-Check` audit is optional, never required, and is useful for post-run audits or when troubleshooting cost reporting. During a run the Scribe calls the same script with `-Write`, which rewrites the ledger sections and the two `state.json` run totals from the history files, so no model copies a derived figure by hand. Add `-SessionLog auto` (the Scribe's `ledgerCommand` already does) to also record real host-reported usage beside the estimates: the model each dispatch actually ran on, real token totals, the session's billed AI units, and a comparison with the same work run on one model without HVE Squad.

The `/` picker lists two entries named `squad`: pick the **prompt** ("Hands a request to the Squad
Coordinator...") to run the squad. The **skill** ("Operating procedure for...") only loads the squad
procedure as context and is normally loaded by the coordinator itself.

## Repository structure

- `apm.yml`: package metadata, dependency list, and scripts
- `apm.lock.yaml`: resolved dependency lock file
- `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1`: dependency generator
- `squad-src/.github/`: locally authored squad source (agents, prompts, instructions, skills)
- `docs/`: documentation site published to GitHub Pages
- `apm_modules/`: installed dependencies (ignored by git)
- `.github/`: generated/deployed local assets (ignored by git, except `.github/workflows/`)

## Versioning

- Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
- See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what is included in each version.
- Consumers can pin to a tagged version, for example `apm install "Peter-N91/hve-squad#vX.Y.z"`.

Releases are cut by hand, when the pending work is judged ready rather than on a schedule.
Between releases, everything already merged is installable from a rolling pre-release tagged
with the version it is going to become:

```powershell
apm install "Peter-N91/hve-squad#vX.Y.z-pre" --target copilot
```

That tag moves on every merge, so re-run the command to pick up the newest build. Use it
to try a fix before it ships; pin a released version for anything you depend on.

## Security

Every change to `main` runs CodeQL, Checkov, Zizmor, OpenSSF Scorecard, and a
three-tier conformance suite over the shipped agent assets. Third-party GitHub
Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs and workflows run with least-privilege
tokens.
